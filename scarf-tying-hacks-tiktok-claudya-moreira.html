Her skin? Creamy perfection. Her bangs? Joni Mitchell would weep. Her aura? Coastal European Lifestyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I was struck initially by her beauty, I stayed for the magic trick she was performing right before my very eyes. I stared at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video</a> as it played over and over on a loop, mesmerized as she pinned the corner of an ordinary black scarf like so, tucked some material here, and shimmied this fold there. Sixty seconds later, somehow, she was wearing a fringed wrap top that fit her like a glove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a West Coast kid who grew up in an era when scarves served as the calling card of WASP-y Ladies Who Brunch (the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>patterned fringe scarf, wrapped like a kerchief</a>), and punk lite emo kids (the too-long skinny scarf, styled like a men's tie), I have previously avoided scarves at all costs, save for the few days a year when my California ass can't handle the East Coast cold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Moreira's feed — an endless scroll of scarf-styling videos that I could more accurately classify as magic trick tutorials — had me questioning my unfair prejudice toward scarves. She demonstrates again and again: a scarf could be for cool girls, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I Zoomed with Claudya in December, our connection between the Philadelphia suburbs (me) and a coastal town in Portugal (Moreira) was spotty, making it difficult to communicate. Despite the lags, her energy radiated through the screen, her bangs as "effortless" as ever. She confirmed what I had guessed, which is that she was a model for many years.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ruben Branches</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moreira was born in Cape Verde, immigrating to Lisbon when she was seven years old. Her studies then took her from Switzerland, to France, to England, and back to Lisbon, where she arrived just before the pandemic in February of last year after 12 years touring the continent. Along the way, she had picked up a few more languages (she speaks Creole from Cape Verde, her mother tongue, as well as Portuguese, English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), a modeling portfolio, a degree in fashion styling, and a desire to make her mark in the fashion industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Becoming famous on a novel social media platform for showing people how to tie her collection of scarves was not, believe it or not, her original dream. When she moved back to Lisbon, she expected to continue her modeling career, but says that she wasn't interested in cultivating the influencer profile that agencies were demanding of her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If I'm going to influence people, I want to influence them with my story," she says of her rejection of #spon life. "I started doing some videos trying to put some outfits together, but I got so bored. I decided this is not what I want to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, she says, she made her way to the buzziest app of them all, TikTok, where she stumbled upon "more creative" content that was in line with the work she had in mind. From there, she made the decision to style some of the scarves she had around her house in unexpected, fresh ways. "In the beginning of [2020] everyone was wearing scarves — they were really popular as crop tops and things like that. I started to play in front of the mirror trying to see if it would turn into something that I like, and something that people also want to wear."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She uploaded her first video in April, and by the start of the new year, Moreira had gained almost 200,000 followers on TikTok; some of her most popular videos are approaching 4 million views.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ruben Branches</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With precision on the level of origami masters, Moreira has "discovered" many new ways to wear what was previously believed (by me, at least) to be a neck accessory and nothing more. Some of her most popular styles, she says, are those in which she attaches a scarf to a blazer, button-up shirt, or vest by looping the material around the button, and then sliding it through the button hole, creating an anchor of sorts for the scarf to then be wrapped around the waist or shoulders. Videos making use of brooches and pins, as well as tutorials for using scarves as bags, are popular as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September of 2020, she launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Zafia</a>, her very own line of scarves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The reason I decided to start my brand is because I was getting such good feedback from people, and they kept asking me where I got my scarves," she says, adding that it was the natural next step for her to pivot to production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's also a sentimental element to making scarves, one that relates back to the women who raised Moreira: her mother and grandmother. "For me, this is an homage to the women from my country. It's amazing that in 2020, women in Cape Verde still wear scarves on their heads, and it's good that they can see a new generation can give a new use to them. My scarves have a story, which is the story of my country, and the story of my culture."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Beside the goal that any entrepreneur has of seeing their company grow, my main hope for Zafia is to create something powerful that has a voice, that says we're all the same, no matter the gender, the color, the body type," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Scarves have a meaning at the culture of my country Cape Verde, and that meaning is respect. That's what I hope that my brand can pass on, the respect for yourself and for the others. It's just a piece of clothing, but it's also more than that, it's something that can highlight your personality, and for me, that's the beauty of it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0r8CrnWasqZ67qHnHmpqkq12ptqzAzqRknKSRqrG6rYympqudmaeu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./common-echo-show-problems-and-how-to-fix-them.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Most Common Echo Show Problems and How to Fix Them</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./odessa-chiklis-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Odessa Chiklis Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
