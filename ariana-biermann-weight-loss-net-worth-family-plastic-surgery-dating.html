I do not have an eating disorder. I worked my ass off to get to where I am today. I am not sick. This is ridiculous and awful to say to someone.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She later posted about some <strong>“insane secret”</strong>&nbsp;following the Instagram Story to have such drastic weight loss. She explained she began<strong> “really working out”</strong> and <strong>“eating healthy”</strong> in January 2020, when she weighed 167 pounds.<strong> “I am now 118 over a year and a half later,”</strong> the influencer revealed and said she ran three to five miles a day with a waist trainer and regularly worked out at the gym.</span></p><p><span>She added,<strong> “I went into a caloric deficit. I did intermittent fasting. I counted my calories. I ate healthy. I stopped snacking. I didn’t drink soda anymore.”</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>“So it is a process. It takes time. But believe in yourself. Do it for you. You got this shit!”</strong> Although the process was<strong> “not easy,”</strong> Ariana said it was the <strong>“best thing”</strong> she did for herself and her body.<strong> “Change doesn’t happen overnight,”</strong> she wrote.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Ariana Biermann</strong></span></h2><p><span>Ariana Biermann has earned some heavy money for her age by appearing in some popular reality TV shows. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>CelebrityNetWorth</a>, she has an estimated net worth of $300 thousand.</span></p><p><span>The pandemic last year got many people to follow some strict lockdown rules, and similarly, Ariana also didn’t go unaffected by it. Through the course of the coronavirus pandemic, she had to change her decision of where to attend college.</span></p><p><span>She intended to attend Arizona State University but later got herself admitted to the Georgia State University hoping to pursue a degree in fashion, as Ariana sat down for an exclusive interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Life</a> along with her sister Brielle as she talked about her love for the realms of <strong>“acting – doing movies,”</strong> on October 2020.</span></p><p><span>Despite her shift in plans, Ariana stayed focused on <a href=# rel=noopener>her goals for the future</a>. <strong>“I’m doing online right now, and then my plan for the next couple of years is either to transfer to UCLA and move to LA or got to SCAD in Atlanta and study fashion,”</strong> she said.</span></p><p><span>Ariana’s career aspirations are all part of her bigger plan<strong> “to detach, per so, from being ‘Kim’s daughter,’”</strong> she admitted.<strong> “It’s just Brielle and Kim, and then there’s me,”</strong> Ariana said, noting that while she wants to start her own fashion business, she wants to follow in her family’s footsteps.<strong> “Seeing how successful my mom is and just all of the amazing companies and brands that she’s done, it just makes me want to be like her and do all of these amazing companies as well.”</strong> She continued to tell about her designing the clothes and her love for fashion designing that make people <strong>“feel beautiful and confident in their own body.”</strong></span></p><h2><span><strong>Did Ariana Biermann Had Plastic Surgery?</strong></span></h2><p><span>The reality TV star <a href=# rel=noopener>denied having some plastic surgery</a> during an Instagram Story Q&A session on 3 July 2021.</span></p><p><span><strong>“LOL no,”</strong> she responded to a fan who asked if she had jaw filler done. However, she was quick to admit to previously&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>getting lip fillers</a>.<strong> “Sure did,”</strong> she replied to another follower. <strong>“And I f—king love them. Best thing I ever did.”</strong></span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/ariana-biermann-before-after.jpg alt="ariana biermann before after" width=650 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Ariana Biermann before and&nbsp;after Lips Filler (©:radaronline)</strong></span></p><p><span>A third social media user later questioned if she had undergone a tummy tuck procedure following her impressive weight loss<strong>. “Nope, just worked my ass off,”</strong> Ariana <a href=# rel=noopener>told the person</a> and later elaborated her weight loss journey via Instagram Story and a post.</span></p><p><span>She also appeared to be against getting breast implants when asked whether she’d<strong> “get the girls done.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Ariana got the top doctors' attention when she had those pouty and juicy lips back when she was just 15 years old. And the specialists, after a close inspection of her looks, claimed that she had her lips injected for those looks. This was later confirmed by Ariana herself in February 2020 of getting her lips done.</span></p><p><span>She also recently underwent a drastic weight loss journey which she shared with her followers on Instagram. But as positive the comment maybe some of them were quite hurtful to the influencer. She then went to TikTok to reflect on her experiences with body-shaming before and after her weight loss.</span></p><p><span>She said on the video that she was called “<strong>fat on social media growing up my whole life… as well as in school.”</strong> After years of bullying, Ariana decided to embark on a fitness journey. <strong>“I looked in the mirror and changed it, and I worked my ass off to get to where the hell I am today and be the skinny legend bad bitch that I am,”</strong> she explained. <strong>“Was I bad bitch before? Hell yes, the baddest. But was I confident, happy loving myself? None of the sorts.”</strong></span></p><p><span>After losing weight, she shared her results on social media. However, she got some bad reception in the comments from her followers as she recalled some of them saying things like<strong> ‘You have an eating disorder, you’re on drugs, you look disgusting… you’re sick, and such.’</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>“None of them were the case but it made me realize no matter what size you are, you will get body-shamed, and it sucks, it’s disgusting – but you’re perfect!”</strong> she concluded.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Family Details Of Ariana Biermann</strong></span></h2><p><span>Ariana Biermann was born on 17 October 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, to a different parent before her adoption, along with her sister Briella to Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kroy Biermann. Her biological father is named Daniel Toce, to whom Kim was married from 2001 to 2003.</span></p><p><span>Kim and Kroy Biermann tied the knot in November 2011, and Kroy announced in July 2013 that he adopted Ariana and her sister Briella.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Kroy, is a producer known for Don’t Be Tardy…, The NFL on CBS, and NFL Monday Night Football. He is also a former American football defensive end and outside linebacker.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Is Ariana Biermann Dating Anyone?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Ariana Biermann is in a relationship with her boyfriend, Aaron Scott.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/ariana-biermann-with-her-boyfriend-aaron-scott.jpg alt="ariana biermann with her boyfriend aaron scott" width=650 height=487 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Ariana Biermann with her boyfriend, Aaron Scott (©:Instagram/Ariana Biermann)</strong></span></p><p><span>In a series of 19 November 2020 Instagram Stories, Ariana answered some questions from her followers. In response to a question that read,<strong> “Which thing you love the most about Aaron?”</strong> Ariana listed a few of her boyfriend’s absolute best qualities alongside a heartwarming photo of the pair sharing a laugh.</span></p><p><span><strong>“Everything,”</strong> she wrote, adding. <strong>“His heart. The way we better each other. His mind. His thoughtfulness.

She shared a series of photos on her Instagram account in March of 2021, to which she captioned, <strong>“Photo dump of me and my best friend.”</strong> The couple seemingly enjoyed a romantic and intimate beach day as they kissed and cuddled tight.</span></p><p><span>Ariana’s boyfriend has a twin brother named Adam. Together the twins have also met with the Biermann family, complete with Kim’s own set of twins, Kaila and Kane. Atlanta-based Good Talent Management represents Aaron.
