You have to watch Mr. Bean’s Holiday, too. Seriously, folks, the media maelstrom of Cannes is wild, and this fest is particularly known for wildin’ out in one particular way: weirdly long standing ovations. (Also <a href=#>booing</a>, but we’re focusing on the positive right now.) Some think it’s a fun tradition and a nice way for filmmakers to get their flowers before they die. Others feel the standing-ovation observation industry is “<a href=#>total bullshit</a>.” Be that as it may, clocking the standing O’s for Cannes premieres has become a pastime of cinephiles, and it’s on its way to becoming one more stat to throw into the <a href=#>Cinematrix</a>. According to <a href=#>IndieWire</a>, the longest ovation to date was a staggering 22 minutes for Pan’s Labyrinth. How will this year’s offerings fare? We’ve ranked the recorded ovations, shortest to longest, including <a href=#>the latest</a>. And because the trades can’t seem to agree on how long any of these standing O’s really run, we’ve calculated the mean average of reported ovations, or MORA (TM! TM!) for each film, with <a href=#>the latest entry</a>, Parthenope. Cannes you believe it?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwfpbh0m000a3b821rwke3dh@published>The Apprentice: about 9.5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwfpbls6000h3b82g92qnxji@published data-word-count=47>Someone might be demanding a pointless recount. <a href=#>Variety</a> reported that the Trump biopic earned an 8-minute standing ovation, while <a href=#>Deadline </a>quotes an 11-minute one. ET <a href=#>shared</a> that it was closer to 10 minutes, which is probably a better estimate considering the 3 minute differences between other outlets.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw8ghx3d001a3b80wolenhqm@published>The Second Act: a “robotic” 3.5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw8gipy7001l3b80911835nf@published data-word-count=52>On <a href=#>Twitter</a>, Variety’s resident standing ovalogist Ramin Setoodeh clocked the standing O for The Second Act (a French comedy about AI invading film) at a “robotic” 3.5 minutes. This is the colorful commentary we need! Did it feel perfunctory, or were people trying to flip their seats in a frenzy of cinephilia?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwcu7kx1000j3b80qe8tcid8@published>Oh, Canada: 3.5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwcvtnpr000x3b80bn9z6h40@published data-word-count=99>More like “Standing O, Canada.” Paul Shrader’s Oh, Canada earned a standing ovation clocking in at 4 minutes, according to <a href=#>Variety</a>, and bringing the director to tears. The film, which stars Richard Gere, Jacob Elordi, and Uma Thurman, tells the story of a writer reflecting on his decision to avoid the Vietnam War draft by fleeing to Canada, with Gere and Elordi playing the older and younger versions of said writer. <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> clocked it in only slightly under 4 minutes, but noted that the film was met “with only polite applause and a perfunctory standing ovation.” Brutal.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwcwreyf00113b80oszaktje@published>Rumours: 5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwcwuahu00153b802exwddc7@published data-word-count=70>All the Rumours are true: the Cate Blanchett-led film, from directors Guy Maddin, Evan Johnson, and Galen Johnson, earned a standing O that came in somewhere between the 4 minute and 6 minute mark, depending on if you’re going by <a href=#>Variety</a> or <a href=#>Deadline</a>’s stopwatch. The dark comedy about a group of world leaders getting lost in the woods at the G7 also stars Alicia Vikander, Roy Dupuis, and Charles Dance.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwb2tek7000a3b81mlih4sef@published>Kinds of Kindness: 5.5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwb2zcn2000k3b811gd5ll69@published data-word-count=95>Yorgos Lanthimos’s latest netted a paltry 4.5-minute clap-athon on May 17, per <a href=#>Variety</a>, which we can only describe as a kind of unkindness when compared to its competitors’ stronger showings. Either audiences’ vocal cords are completely exhausted from this week’s ovations, or the film’s sex and cannibalism and weirdo curiosities featuring Emma Stone made them want to exit the Palais as quickly as possible. Lanthimos, for his part, literally <a href=#>ducked</a> out. On Twitter, Washington Post reporter Jada Yuan <a href=#>clarified</a> that the O ended six minutes after the movie, but people stopped clapping during the credits.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwcxmbpa00193b80prhqcrbt@published>The Surfer: 6 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwcxmkkl001d3b80zcqiz63q@published data-word-count=56>Forget a standing ovation, the audience for The Surfer should have stuck to theme and done the wave. The Nicolas Cage-led film enjoyed a 6 minute standing ovation, according to <a href=#>Variety</a>, which was complemented by Cage grabbing the mic and shouting “mangez le rat,” French for “eat the rat,” which is a line in the film.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw8gg3y200143b80r8rwtlg7@published>Furiosa: 7 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw8gltk6001r3b8027dug1ef@published data-word-count=57>Furiosa was where the girls (the trades) started fighting. Deadline, Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter all gave different times for the length of <a href=#>Furiosa</a>’s ovation. According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, George Miller’s epic prequel got “nearly 8.” <a href=#>Setoodeh</a> put the ovation at a mere six minutes. And <a href=#>THR</a> split the diff at seven minutes.

How much of that applause was for the sheer audacity of having a guy in the audience ask a question of Adam Driver in the movie, then having Driver-in-movie respond? As unclear as the timing of this ovation. The MORA score on this one is a tidy 8 minutes.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clw9ido48000b3b819b2svxw1@published>Bird: 9 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clw9ij0z5000p3b81miwgwlco@published data-word-count=72>One of the longest reported standing ovations was attributed to Andrea Arnold’s Bird, starring the formerly self-described <a href=#>“little freak man-child”</a> <a href=#>Barry Keoghan</a> and <a href=#>Passages</a> chaos agent <a href=#>Franz Rogowski</a>. According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, the “enthusiastic” ovation lasted “in excess of 11 minutes,” while <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> says it went on for a mere seven. Or, in pop terms, a little more than a doubleshot of <a href=#>“Espresso.”</a> Which gives a total MORA of 9 min.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwdyqhdt000a3b804a0qhen1@published>Horizon: An American Saga: 9.5 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwdyqlht000e3b80uhcsq4qb@published data-word-count=102>Yee haw! Kevin Costner’s Western epic, Horizon: An American Saga, earned a seven-minute standing ovation according to <a href=#>Variety</a>. However, <a href=#>People</a> and <a href=#>THR</a> both reported 10 minutes, while <a href=#>Deadline</a> amped it up to a whopping 11-min O. The reception brought Costner, who starred, produced, co-wrote, and helped finance the film, to tears as he promised the audience at least three sequels. What is this, Pixar? But the film’s more than three-hour runtime might have been an issue for some, with Variety noting that there were “scores of walkouts” — but to be fair that’s a long time to go without a bathroom break.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwcu476a000a3b80l78f5u6v@published>Emilia Pérez: 10 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwcu4brt000e3b80a79njonz@published data-word-count=73>Jacques Audiard’s Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez, starring Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez and Karla Sofía Gascón, earned the longest standing ovation of the festival thus far. According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, it clocked in at 9 minutes, while <a href=#>Deadline</a> reports that it was more than 11 minutes. That discrepancy is likely on account of Audiard interrupting the ovation to thank the audience, with Deadline reporting that the applause quickly resumed for at least two more minutes.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwe5l5pk000e3b80hfl79app@published>The Substance: 11 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwe5lh9g000l3b80o18ltd4y@published data-word-count=74><a href=#>THR</a> clocked the Demi Moore/Margaret Qualley body horror film getting a 9-minute O. This outperforms Qualley’s other Cannes proj, Kinds of Kindness by at least 3 minutes. But if you believe <a href=#>Deadline</a>, the film got 13 minutes of gorgeous, gorgeous applause. The film is reportedly one of the more “out there” films to premiere at Cannes since Titane. Apparently 2024 is the time for freaky shit. “Gimme Demi Moore, gimme Moore!” cried the Croisette.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwh8bap8000a3b71goxi9lld@published>Anora: 8.75 Minutes</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwgyxttq000h3b80eg4qta0s@published data-word-count=66>Sean Baker’s Anora, which stars Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn stripper who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, received a 7.5-minute standing O, according to <a href=#>Variety</a>. The outlet also noted that the audience cheered several times during the film itself. Maybe <a href=#>Deadline</a> was accounting for all of that extra applause with its much-higher estimate of 10 minutes?
