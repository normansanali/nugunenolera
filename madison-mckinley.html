Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Madison McKinley’s net worth is reported to be $800,000, which she acquired primarily through her time on “The Bachelor.”</p><h2><span id=Madison_McKinley-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Madison McKinley- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>McKinley was born Madison Garton on March 13, 1986, in Vail, Colorado, where she grew up and attended college. Although nothing is known about her childhood, she wanted to become a model at the age of 16, eventually competing in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Competition in Manhattan at the age of 18. Although McKinley did not win, she was noticed by several modeling agencies in New York and decided to relocate there to pursue a career in modeling and acting. She also opted to alter her surname to McKinley at the same time.</p><h2><span id=Madison_McKinley-_Relationship_Married_Life>Madison McKinley- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>McKinley married US tennis player John Isner in December 2017, after dating anyone for several years.

McKinley and 29 other females entered the challenge to win the bachelor Brad Womack’s heart. When she displayed her vampire teeth implants, she acquired the nickname “Fang Girl” — it was discovered that she had a strong love of vampires and even joined the New York Underground Vampire Club when she relocated to the city.</p><p>Aside from her passion for vampires, McKinley earned the love and respect of the show’s viewers when she dropped out of the competition in the third week. When she found out what had transpired in fellow participant Emily Maynard’s history, she opted to quit the game freely and enable her to go on. When it was revealed that Maynard’s first love had died in a plane crash, McKinley realized that Maynard required “The Bachelor” more than she did.
