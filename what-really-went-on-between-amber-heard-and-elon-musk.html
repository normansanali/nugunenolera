Well, there are rumors of what went down while she was still married to Depp. It seems that while Johnny was away Amber would play. Plus, even better, at one point a supermodel gets in on the action.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And in 2016 post-Johnny there is the "official" version, as Musk and Heard openly dated for a year. Why did it end? Well, the public statement the duo issued claimed they were both just too busy. Some think there is much more to it.</p><p>Heard, of course, denies the rumors. She claims to have done no wrong. But still, there is some tantalizing evidence out there.</p><p>So, let's have a look at what went on between&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actress&nbsp;Amber Heard</a> and Elon Musk, both before and after her acrimonious split from Johnny Depp.</p><h2 id=a-man-obsessed>A Man Obsessed</h2><p>Musk has long had a "thing" for Amber Heard. In 2013, Elon made a cameo appearance in Robert Rodriquez's film&nbsp;Machete Kills. And he kind of got obsessed with the beautiful blonde actress. The only thing was&nbsp;Amber Heard was seriously dating Johnny Depp at the time.</p><p>There was one other problem: Musk didn't have any scenes with Heard and so he pestered Rodriquez and others to wangle an introduction, saying he was just interested in her as a person. Sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber more or less dodged a set up with Musk. Believe it or not, she and Johnny Depp were supremely happy at the time. Depp had even left his longtime partner Vanessa Paradis to be with Heard after the two met on the set of 2011's&nbsp;Rum Diary.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Rumors Amber Heard Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><h2 id=the-actress-the-billionaire-and-the-supermodel>The Actress, The Billionaire, And The Supermodel</h2><p>Elon Musk does not give up easily. One way or the other, rumor has it that Elon Musk persisted in his pursuit of Amber Heard, even after Depp and Heard married in 2015. And we all know how that went, don't we? The marriage became a battleground early on, with tales of drunken fights and violence. Depp blamed Heard. Heard blamed Depp.</p><p>Whatever happened, Depp and Heard were spending a lot of time apart. Rumor has it that Heard began seeing Musk in 2015, while Depp was away in Australia filming&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heard, of course, denied the rumors. But a security guard swore blind that on a number of occasions&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2015, he had seen Heard and Musk together</a> in the Los Angeles penthouse where she and Depp lived.</p><p>Fast forward to 2016 after Heard and Depp had split. Amber was living in the L.A. penthouse. Pictures of Musk and Heard cuddling in the private elevator were bad enough. Some said that Musk even had a key to the penthouse.</p><p>But then shots of model Cara Delevingne going up to the penthouse added a whole new dimension.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Heard And Bianca Butti Pack On The PDA</a></span></p><p>The resident concierge said of the trio: "I saw them going up and down the elevator over and over again." What was going on between the three of them? Some thought the worst and suspected a ménage&nbsp;à trois. It is plausible enough. Cara very infamously is known to swing both ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And&nbsp;Cosmopolitan reported that Amber Heard came out as bisexual in 2010, saying, “I don’t label myself one way or another—I have had successful relationships with men and now a woman. I love who I love; it’s the person that matters.” The woman in question was artist Tasya van Ree. She got dumped when Johnny came along.</p><p>And Elon Musk, the guy who predicted humans will be overtaken by artificial intelligence, is just off-the-wall enough to be up for just about anything.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk May Be Convinced That Aliens Built The Pyramids</a></span></p><h2 id=heard-s-mom-called-johnny-depp-an-angel>Heard's Mom Called Johnny Depp "An Angel"?</h2><p>Well, at some point in 2016, Amber Heard and Elon Musk came out as an official couple.</p><p>Now, you can probably tell from Musk's early obsession with Heard that the guy has some pretty big emotional issues. While they were dating, he gave Amber a Tesla electric car. Only thing was, he had major trust issues and had the car bugged so he could keep up with what "his" Amber got up to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this came out after Depp filed his defamation lawsuit against Heard in 2019. A friend of Amber's sister Whitney, one Jennifer Howell, gave a sworn statement in which she said Elon Musk had given Amber a "bugged" Tesla. And, rather sensationally she also put in that Amber's mom Paige disliked the "controlling" billionaire, saying compared to Musk <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp was an "angel" or a "saint"</a>. Howell claimed that Paige hoped Amber and Johnny would reconcile. You can imagine what Amber's lawyers had to say about that one!</p><p>Well, the Elon Musk thing with Amber Heard didn't last. They dated for about a year before they announced they were splitting. The pair claimed that they were both just too busy to make it work. But some suspected Musk was in a rush to distance himself from the whole Depp/Heard battle. And who can blame him?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, Elon is all loved up with his baby mama, Canadian musician Grimes. And Amber? She's been linked with Heidi Klum's ex-boy toy, art dealer Vito Schnabel. And Johnny Depp? After losing his UK libel trial, he is probably holed up avoiding the world in general, and the press in particular.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Moment Everything Started Going Downhill For Johnny Depp</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGavlaPBbrvNZpmerKeasq95wKaZnqpdnbKivsNmmKecXZq5sLqMpqyso18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-shamar-mccos-parents-shamar-mcco-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more-545900-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Shamar Mccos Parents?
