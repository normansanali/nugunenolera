The actress’ resume is impressive and certainly diverse, with roles in Hollywood comedies such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We’re the Millers</a> as well as appearing in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scream</a> franchise.&nbsp;She’s become synonymous with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Horror Story</a> which has cemented her as an icon of horror.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/4qniWD7bFu0?si=_mszYrZllC7-sl77</figure><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>But how much has Roberts earned from her roles so far, if you’re curious about the 32 year old’s net worth and other such details, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>The Holidate star was always likely to have a wildly successful career in acting, considering she was born into Hollywood royalty. She’s the daughter of actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Roberts</a> and niece of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia Roberts</a>, who most likely helped her to get started, but since then she’s really taken off and made a name for herself.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Roberts first acting credit goes all the way back to the 2001 crime film Blow in which she played Kristina Jung, the daughter of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Depp’s</a> character, George Jung. She continued to gain recognition as a child star throughout the early and mid 2000s, appearing in the lead role on the Nickelodeon show Unfabulous until 2007. During that time she appeared in supporting and lead roles in numerous other Hollywood titles such as Aquamarine, Nancy Drew, and Hotel for Dogs.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>During her adulthood, Roberts continued to land big roles in massive productions, although she is now probably most well known for American Horror Story, in which she’s been consistently appearing since 2013, and as a result of which she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently came under fire from AHS:1984 co-star Angelica Ross</a> for allegedly contributing towards a hostile workplace environment. The Netflix series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scream Queens</a> might also be where you’ve seen her before, the horror anthology is another of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Murphy’s</a> creations, although compared to AHS it has more of a comedic tone.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>All this and we haven’t even touched on her singing career and her modeling. The point is the actress has many many streams of income and therefore no shortage of income so what we’d all like to know is just how much is Miss Roberts actually worth?</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>As of 2023 the Nerve star has a net worth of around $25 million, obviously this can fluctuate depending on how much work she takes on per year. However, her consistent appearances in AHS and frequent Hollywood work means she’s never likely going to be strapped for cash. Her annual earnings sit somewhere around $2 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CooPWB.</a></p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Her earnings look like they’ll continue to rise as the actress is appearing in the latest season of American Horror Story as well as Sony’s upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madame Web</a>, where she’ll be appearing as Mary Parker. Appearing in a Marvel movie can only raise Robers’ net worth, as we all know, the Marvel club can be a lucrative one, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unless of course you’re a VFX artist.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZWiuqJ50aiZnqqkqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joie-chavis-wiki-dating-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Joie Chavis?
