Her introductory piece was memorable for saying some weird things for someone who was about to spend a lot of time on the beach. “I can’t open my eyes in the sun and I have less botox on my eyes this time.”</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Yet, she topped it by adding, “I actually hate sand. I’m from Florida and I literally hate sand.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>i really wish brooklyn was here right now with this kat meltdown so we could get a part two of this <a href=#>#BachelorInParadise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2MthaV0O7Z</a></p>— nina 🪩📨 (@ninabubblygum) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>When she hit the sand, to her apparent discontent, she certainly spent a lot of time on it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brayden</a> was her first suitor as they were playful together and shared a few kisses that earned Kat a rose. She did say something not-so-complimentary about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">receiving attention from Brayden</a>, describing him by saying, “He’s like a golden retriever.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>However, Kat herself was soon about to turn into a pit bull. Before she did, she complained about bugs and kept calling them “scanadians,” until Brayden humorously realized she was trying to say “cicadas.”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Things started to change for the scanadian-hating Kat, because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner arrived</a> and chose her for a date. She happily said yes, which was no surprise considering she told everyone at the revealing bonfire that she would like to see Tanner on the beach.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brayden happily kissing Rachel, one of the sweetest girls on the beach whilst Kat is having a meltdown is such fun karma. Jokes aside, Kat if you’re happy, then you shouldn’t be going off like this. <a href=#>#BachelorInParadise</a></p>— S.J. (งツ)ว (@Sarena_Jackson) <a href=#>October 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Then came the most awkward moment of the season as, just prior to the date, she walked to where everyone was waiting. Brayden stood right there and said, “Hi. You look gorgeous.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>She simply ignored him in front of everyone and greeted them all instead. Tanner soon showed up and off they went. When she returned from the date she told Brayden she wasn’t interested in him anymore, brushing him off easily.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Brayden told the confessional camera, “She was warm with me one second and then just cold as ice the next.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Kat seemed annoyed that Brayden was talking about things with other people because it made her look bad, so she spoke to him again but mostly tried to tell him not to feel that way.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>She also said, in the confessional where the contestants speak to the camera, “I have dealt with men like that when I was 21. I am 27, almost, and I don’t have time for that. That is some immature bulls***, seriously.”</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>She said something that made it seem that she was really trying to convince herself that she didn’t actually use Brayden for a rose — which allowed her to stay on the beach — saying, “This is very difficult for me, too….I think.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kat YOU are the problem… she lacks so much self-awareness it’s wild 😂 <a href=#>#bachelorinparadise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YvzGesBH7Y</a></p>— Steph R. 🦋🌻 (@stephdizzle11) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>No one else seemed to agree with Kat. Everyone, including the women, felt Kat had used Brayden. So, Kat wanted to talk to Brayden again, though this time in an attempt to clear her name, which she was ironically about to ruin in a grand way.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Despite Kat becoming frustrated, Brayden was very calm and simply expressed how he felt. Yet, it was Kat who angrily told him, “I feel like you’re so confrontational and argumentative. I just want it to be normal and have a conversation and I don’t want to argue.”</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=79 data-injectable=false>It was clear that Kat just wanted Brayden to agree with her, which he didn’t.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>She then spoke with Aaron S because she wasn’t happy that he also had a similar opinion about her, since he is good friends with Brayden. However, it didn’t go well. He was mature in his response and she wasn’t. So, she took to the confessional that night and let out her frustrations in one of the most embarrassing and craziest moments of the season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kat: “I know that I’m a graceful, and respectful and charismatic person” … <a href=#>#bachelorinparadise</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gC8JkAdOk1</a></p>— Steph R. 🦋🌻 (@stephdizzle11) <a href=#>October 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Kat Izzo sat down, looked at the camera, and went off. She quickly began to actually scream.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>It started with, “Things get misinterpreted amongst the boys, which is classic. I mean, that’s been a theme here lately. Get your s*** together! Be mature men! Why are we still talking about something that f***ing happened days ago?! I can give a f*** what the weird men on this beach think of me. I literally don’t care!” I don’t need to f***ing talk to toxic men!”</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>She then focused her anger on Aaron S for some reason, screaming, “Go f***ing hang out with the crabs! There’s a reason you’re single at 33! Aaron S has got to go. Shut the f*** up! Literally shut the f*** up! I know that I’m a graceful and respectful and charismatic person, and I’m confident in that.

Kat loses it. “Are you kidding me? You say yes on my birthday?! Of course I’m pissed off!”</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>Later that night she screams, “I just wanna hit something!” and when the others present her with a birthday cake she takes it and walks over to the beach and ditches it by the ocean.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy 8th birthday to Cake By The Ocean 🥳 <a href=#>#JoeJonas</a> <a href=#>#dnce</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HF8UkRUMUl</a></p>— Ashley G (@itsAshleyG_27) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>Are you exhausted yet?
