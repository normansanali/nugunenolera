In a hurry since adolescence, at 16 he talked his way into acting classes with Stella Adler; at 20, he persuaded Clifford Odets to let him direct one of his plays Off Broadway; and he went on to befriend and write about the golden-age movie directors he idolized, like Orson Welles and John Ford. As soon as Bogdanovich became a director in his own right, his self-assurance didn’t endear him to some of the town’s young auteurs or old legends. “I don’t judge myself on the basis of my contemporaries,” he told the New York Times in 1971. “I judge myself against the directors I admire — Hawks, Lubitsch, Buster Keaton, Welles, Ford, Renoir, Hitchcock. I certainly don’t think I’m anywhere near as good as they are, but I think I’m pretty good.” And so, as the story goes, Bogdanovich directed two arguably perfect films, The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon, along with the hit screwball comedy What’s Up, Doc?, only to see his career run aground after a series of flops. But contrary to the legend, Bogdanovich never disappeared or stewed in defeat for long, and he has enjoyed no fewer than three critically hailed comebacks with Saint Jack (1979), Mask (1985), and Cat’s Meow (2002), as well as significant late-career success as a documentarian, as with 2007’s Tom Petty documentary, Runnin’ Down a Dream. Bogdanovich has also shown himself to be a surprisingly supple actor in such roles as The Sopranos’ shrink-to-the-shrink, Dr. Elliot Kupferberg, and Netflix recently released a <a href=#>completed version of Welles’s long-unfinished The Other Side of the Wind</a>, in which Bogdanovich, in the thick of his ’70s success, played a version of himself named Brooks Otterlake, a role Welles wrote to explore the fraught Oedipal themes of their own relationship. Now 79, Bogdanovich is noticeably frail as he recovers from a fall he suffered while at a French film festival, where he collected a lifetime-­achievement award; he shattered his left femur. We talk at a cluttered dining-room table in the modest ground-floor Toluca Lake apartment he shares with his ex-wife Louise Stratten and her mother. Mid-interview, a diminutive, grandmotherly woman with a Dutch accent sneaks behind him through the tight dining room on her way to the kitchen. Bogdanovich motions at my copy of The Killing of the Unicorn, the book he wrote about the 1980 murder of his then-girlfriend, Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten, Louise’s sister. “Hide that book, will you?” he requests. “That is Dorothy’s mother.” Nelly Hoogstraten appears several more times: to deliver him pills, to ask if he’d like her to make coffee, to see when he’d like his dinner. “Thank you, darling,” he answers every time.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjsqm5n3y00353a66w67zt2t1@published data-word-count=48><strong>You grew up in New York.

Did you have a brother die before you were born?</strong><br><strong></strong>Yeah. I didn’t even know about any of it until I was about 7. I was in the room of the apartment where my father painted. I saw a sketchy painting of a young boy with blond hair, and I said, “Who’s that?” And he said, “That’s your brother.” I said, “My brother?” “Yes, he died.” And he didn’t say much else. My mother never spoke of him. Years later, toward the end of my mother’s life, I interviewed her about things and I asked her about this tragedy. She told me about it, but it was very difficult for her to talk about even then. She got choked up and she couldn’t go on. I was born into that tragedy, actually.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjsqm5n5900373a66ly7q5wrh@published data-word-count=71><strong>Was it an accident?<br></strong>It was a kitchen accident. She was boiling some soup and the kid got near the soup and she got scared and she went to try to stop him from touching the soup and the soup fell on him and he died of shock.

The kid was a year and a half old.<strong></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjsqm5n5b00383a660xqragnu@published data-word-count=35><strong>I cannot even imagine.<br></strong>Terrible.

He was a really great painter and very highly praised in the former Yugoslavia. But he gave all that up to save my mother and her family because they were Jewish. He wasn’t, but they were. So he got visitors’ visas for my mother and him and her immediate family and they all came over in ’39 for the World’s Fair in New York. That was the ostensible reason, yeah.

She kept saying, “I want to rehearse that last scene with you.” I said, “No, I don’t want to see it.” I wanted it to be fresh to me. She could rehearse it a hundred times, but I didn’t want to see it until the end.

Then I not only got stoned but I had an affair and left my wife. So I wasn’t square after all. You know the story about when Cybill came to audition for me?

What happened was I went to a supermarket to get some toothpicks because I was trying to quit smoking cigarettes, so I would just chew toothpicks. So at the checkout, there was a copy of Glamour, a magazine I had never heard of. On the cover was this girl, and she had a shirt on that said I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU. But I thought to myself the look on her face belies the sentiment. She doesn’t look like she really loves me in the picture. So I bought the magazine and gave it to my assistant Mae Woods, and I said, “Find out who this girl is, would you?” She was Cybill Shepherd. She gave it to me typed out, and I thought “Cybill” spelled C-Y-B-I-L-L is a bit much.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjsqm5nay003s3a66sthpdljm@published data-word-count=116><strong>Polly also said that it was her, not you, whom Sal Mineo had given a copy of </strong><strong>The Last Picture Show</strong><strong> and that you hadn’t actually read the novel before production was green-lit.<br></strong>Oh, that’s bullshit.

I said to Polly, “Why don’t you read this and tell me what it’s sort of saying.” And then she read it and said, “It’s a very good book, but I don’t know how you’d make it as a picture.” That was what happened.
