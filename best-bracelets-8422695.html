While the iconic piece is certainly a stunner worthy of decade-long admiration, we promise there are plenty of other eye-catching bracelets for a small fraction of the French retailer’s. In a world where <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>earrings and necklaces</a> feel like the bread and butter of accessories, some would say bracelets are an important seasoning that gives your outfit its flavor. That’s why it’s vital to pick a piece that you yourself can love and feel proud to wear every day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve enlisted the help of a few stylists to call out their favorites right now — which range in color, metal, style, and price point. They spoke to us about current trends, how to build a collection of jewelry staples, and the best ways to keep jewelry from clashing. Of course, there isn’t a one-for-all rule when it comes to bracelets, be they a lifetime treasure to wear every day or a quirky beaded bracelet reminiscent of your childhood summer camp.

It’s a dainty bracelet on a solid gold chain, and it doesn’t tarnish in the face of water and sweat. The slim piece measures 2.5 millimeters wide, which is just thick enough to sparkle without being overpowering. Basically, it matches just about anything, making it great for everyday wear. The link chain design is also classic, representing elegance and strength. It’s only offered in one size, but the 7-inch length should fit most wrists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>14-karat yellow gold<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>7 inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ottoman-hands-hazel-chain-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ottoman Hands Hazel Chain Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Ottoman Hands Hazel Chain Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_11MRZT_yHcsK5STjCGqNiEj6u8=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ottoman-Hands-Hazel-Chain-Bracelet-ee47ad0ae89f42aa93fd3b704ded68aa.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ottoman Hands</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ’70s-inspired style never fails to look sophisticated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The base material is brass, and without proper care, it will tarnish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those who are nostalgic for the 1970s will appreciate this vintage-inspired bracelet that features a foldover clasp and dainty rice grain chain. And while most options on this list use either 14-karat or 18-karat gold, this one utilizes 21-karat gold. Still, it’s gold-plated recycled brass, which is known to tarnish over time and leave a greenish residue on the skin once the plating weathers off. While gold will do a better job at protecting the brass for a longer time, you’ll still want to remove the jewelry before going to bed or showering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>21-karat gold-plated recycled brass<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>7 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fine-jewelry-jennifer-fisher-14k-long-link-charm-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fine Jewelry</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jennifer Fisher Charm Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jenna Fisher 14k Long Link Charm Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7Zc_oze3Gz8RevQUDTwk6TKSB-8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jennifer-fisher-14k-long-link-charm-bracelet-b0d627556ace479c8a4d19d57e8ba740.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jenna Fisher</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can add charms along the bracelet.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The price changes drastically depending on the color you choose.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going to splurge on an item, make sure it stands the test of time in terms of both material and style. This bracelet from fine jewelry brand Jennifer Fisher checks off both of those boxes. Made of 14-karat gold, the link chain bracelet won’t tarnish through the years nor will the classic style clash with anything you wear. You even have the option of adding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">the little charms</a> you collect through the years on each hoop which represent the story of your adventures through the years.

This subtle and small accessory is mostly made up of a rippled black adjustable band, and as we all know, black goes with everything. To give it a little pizzazz, however, at the center, you’ll find a real lab-grown diamond wrapped in some 14-karat gold-plated sterling silver. It’s small, dainty, and easy to slide on and off for when you hop in the shower (which by the way, you absolutely should be considering the material it’s made of). Finding something that’s made of a diamond and 14-karat gold-plated sterling silver that’s under $100 is a rarity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>14-karat gold plated sterling silver, diamonds, nylon<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>Adjustable | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-friendship-catbird-candy-chain-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Friendship</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Catbird Candy Chain Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Catbird Candy Chain Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DHoqRhV4gV10wJ1aIsv3VLzjBYQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/catbird-candy-chain-bracelet-afe331617780464d86461ee8b0214a38.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Catbird</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The recycled solid gold won’t fade, much like your friendship.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are only four color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Grab three of your best friends and get each one a matching friendship bracelet from Catbird. This dainty little piece offers a simple chain speckled with colored beads. One can have the blue version, another the green, one the orange, and another the black. Made of 100 percent recycled 14-karat gold, the chain won't easily fade or tarnish, much like your friendship. It’s a cute and subtle way to seal the squad and have something in common (aside from your humor and stellar personalities) that you can all share. Catbird even offers the chain in two sizes, a 6- to 7-inch option and a 7- to 8-inch length. If your group is larger than four people, you’ll be out of luck, as it only comes in these four colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled solid 14-karat gold | <strong>Size:</strong> 6–7 inch, 7–8 inch | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-dior-petit-cd-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Petit CD Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dior Petit CD Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DxPB8lu9urO9DJBCUBNlfTQOUVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dior-petit-cd-bracelet-c695dad2161b42b9aced5d64f4d895b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dior</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a quiet luxury appeal.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not made of solid gold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love this Dior piece because while it’s a dainty yet eye-catching bracelet, it’s not yelling “designer.” It holds a certain quiet luxury appeal to it, as it only features a gold chain, a white pearl (also available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">black pearl</a>), Christian Dior’s initials, and a simple dangly pendant. And while it looks subtle and beautiful on its own, it also serves as a great stackable piece. Combine it with a few chunky bracelets to recreate Dior’s iconic wrist look. For a luxury piece, we’re surprised to see that it’s not made of solid gold. Instead, the gold-finish metal will require some TLC to maintain its pristine appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Gold-finish metal, resin-pearl<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>6.5–7.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bangle-monica-vinader-siren-muse-bangle-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bangle</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Monica Vinader Siren Muse Bangle Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Monica Vinader Siren Muse Bangle Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FnNvZavvGYMloA18TepZhgoYyMw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Monica-Vinader-Siren-Muse-Bangle-Set-04fe43d4427346c38cbe842b6bf8e0bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Monica Vinader</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in four sizes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you want more than three pieces, you have to add a new set to your cart.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is there a bracelet more classic than the bangle?

Made of soft calfskin leather and gold-plated accents, the seemingly minimalist piece makes an elegant statement. It’s the ultimate if-you-know-you-know piece, as the iconic clasp shape is a signature of the designer. Still, it doesn’t look like the most secure of clasps, particularly if you compare it to the double-locking closure from the diamond tennis bracelet you’re about to read about, below.

Combined with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lab-grown diamond trend</a>, it’s much easier to frost your wrist with diamonds these days — and I mean, who can resist? James Allen lets you choose your diamond size from one to 10 karats with this piece, so you can make it as dainty or as splashy as you desire. You can even pick various colors and materials for the chain like white gold or rose gold. Of course, all these customizations will change the price of the item pretty dramatically. And, there’s a double clasp (clip in and then fold over a lock) to keep it from accidentally falling off or anyone snatching it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>14-karat white gold, lab-grown diamonds<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>7 inches with re-sizing available for a fee | <strong>Colors: </strong>4<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pearl-mejuri-mini-pearl-satellite-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pearl</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mejuri Mini Pearl Satellite Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mejuri Mini Pearl Satellite Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O_yUoAQ1hKpm9_OgJsIceiZr1Xs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mejuri-mini-pearl-satellite-bracelet-3b829b66d0ee4a3a8aeea4647a827a2e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mejuri</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>18-karat gold on sterling silver will hold up well for the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>For anyone who is vegan, these fresh-water mussel pearls will not bode well with their lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pearls are another one of those classic accessories that always look elegant and never go out of style. These ones from Mejuri are indeed real, farmed from oysters and fresh-water mussels. And while such gemstones typically come with a high price tag, Mejuri makes them more attainable for the everyday consumer with attractive pricing. The five pearls sit on an 18-karat solid gold on sterling silver chain. This will weather everyday conditions better than your average gold-on-brass material, but we still recommend taking good care of this bracelet as pearls and sterling silver aren’t foolproof to tarnishing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>18-karat gold plated sterling silver, fresh-water mussel pearls<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>6–7, 7–8 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cuff-missoma-molten-knot-double-cuff-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cuff</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Missoma Double Cuff Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Missoma Molten Knot Double Cuff Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZHenBR-uX03j-AUec3dD-FnGLq8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/missoma-molten-knot-double-cuff-bracelet-767743eed70d4038bbc0697fe2fb5527.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Missoma</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The style is unique yet simple, making it elegant enough for special events and casual enough for everyday wear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may be difficult to slip into the bracelet.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This cuff isn’t like any other cuff — it’s got a double band with a twisted knot at the center. The style is equal amounts unique and simple, making it easy to wear to both upscale and casual outings. Made of 18-karat vermeil gold-plated brass, the shiny piece can handle a fair amount of wear without losing its pristine condition. You have to slip your wrist in, which can be slightly challenging without any clasps or adjustable features. But that’s just the nature of a cuff, unfortunately, and the elegant style is worth the bit of trouble to put on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>18-karat gold on recycled brass<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>S/M, M/L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-personalized-monica-vinader-id-oval-charm-adjustable-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Personalized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Monica Vinader ID Oval Charm Adjustable Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Monica Vinader ID Oval Charm Adjustable Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FKq4yZRUAUXxq8QV6w-YryFJ3UI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Monica-Vinader-ID-Oval-Charm-Adjustable-Bracelet-718ab76782854a6982fb321ac7f8d298.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Monica Vinader</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The engraving comes complimentary.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Once engraved, all sales are final.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This engravable charm bracelet from Monica Vinader deserves a spot on your wrist. You can customize the little pendant with an engraving, which, by the way, comes complimentary as part of the bracelet. While many personalized jewelry only offer one font and a few letters to add, this one can even add emojis, and adjust the font style and size so long as it fits into the designated space. Constellations, zodiac signs, zodiac animals, and even Chinese New Year symbols are offered as well, which is far more than we have ever seen on another brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you have your significant other’s/mom’s/dog’s name beautifully engraved, you can carry it with you wherever you go.

It’s dainty but still substantial, and its simple design makes it easy to wear on the regular. It’s about a quarter of an inch thick and has a circumference of 7.5 inches (6.6 inches inner circumference) with no adjustable features, so make sure this sizing is suitable for you. While we personally adore the woven chain design, we’re also well aware that these links sometimes pinch the hair on your skin and feel a little uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>18-karat gold plated recycled sterling silver<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>7.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-birthstone-missoma-birthstone-chain-bracelet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Birthstone</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Missoma Birthstone Chain Bracelet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Missoma Birthstone Chain Bracelet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GcsHaDK671V9fNinqmk5sqJAYI8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/missoma-birthstone-chain-bracelet-62c07f8a9c8346fe811aca995431b224.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Missoma</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The unique material makes it last longer and look more high-end than standard gold-plated jewelry.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>According to the reviews, the chain is slightly thinner in real life than pictured.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want something a little personal without taking the customization route, a birthstone bracelet might offer enough individuality. Missoma lists out which gemstone matches your birth month, so you can easily select the “color” that corresponds with yours. The tiny gem is secured by an 18-karat recycled gold-plated vermeil on a recycled silver chain, which in simple terms means that there is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">thicker layer of gold added to the base silver material</a>. In other words, it will last longer than gold-plated brass, allowing you to enjoy the piece without it breaking down on you immediately.

However, such alternatives require a little more tender love and care if you hope to maintain the quality and extend their lifespan.

As the name suggests, gold-plated is not solid gold. It’s a layer of gold coating on another material, like brass or sterling silver, which can tarnish over time. Solid gold on the other hand will maintain its pristine condition through the years — now it’s up to you if you want 14-karat, 18-karat, or the more elusive 21-karat. Karat refers to a percentage of the pure gold in a piece of jewelry, with 24k representing 100 percent. Unfortunately, pure gold is not rock-solid or durable. It can mend and break easily, which is why long-lasting jewelry blends in other materials to create 14-karat and 18-karat golds. These are stronger and thereby more suitable for everyday wear.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What hand is best for bracelets?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, this is up to you, but there are a few things to consider based on the advice of enthusiasts and experts. For example, Associate Fashion Commerce Editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hayley Prokos</a> makes it a habit never to stack chunky jewelry (or any jewelry, for that matter) on the same wrist that she wears her watch for fear that the pieces will scratch it. The case is similar for those who are right-handed — substantial wrist jewelry is typically worn on the left, too, so that it doesn’t get in the way or cause undue friction when grabbing top-shelf items or using a mouse, to make a couple of examples.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I stack or layer bracelets?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>necklaces</a>, bracelets can be stacked and styled in a similar manner.
