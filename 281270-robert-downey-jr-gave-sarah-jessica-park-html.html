However, there was a time in the 80s and early 90s when the actors had a romantic relationship together.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The former couple started dating in 1984 after they met on the film "Firstborn." Parker portrayed a character named Lisa, while Downey played Lee in the movie.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>LEFT: Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert Downey Jr. pictured 61st Annual Academy Awards.

However, despite breaking up 20 years ago, Parker revealed that their relationship taught her a few valuable life lessons.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 2016, Parker sat down with People and Entertainment Weekly Director Jess Cagle and gave an insightful look into her past romantic relationship with the action movie star. She first <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yMRYReJiPE">explained </a>about their relationship:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"It taught me how I love."</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Robert Downey Jr. and Sarah Jessica Parker at the screening of the CBS Television Movie "Going for the Gold: The Bill Johnson Story," 1985, Los Angeles, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Furthermore, her relationship with the "Dolittle" actor, who struggled with drug and alcohol abuse during much of their relationship, taught her the difference between loving someone and taking care of someone.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The seven-year relationship helped Parker realize what was necessary for caring for a partner and what adults should or should not provide for their partner.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Besides learning how to set boundaries, the "Footloose" actress credited her relationship with Downey for teaching her a bit about parenting.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She reasoned this was because she would do things and care for Downey in a way that was more suitable for a parent than a romantic partner, as she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yMRYReJiPE">told </a>to Cagle:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"The things that I ended up caring about, and the way I cared for Downey, were things that might be more suitable for a parent at a certain point."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Therefore, it helped her raised her three children, James Wilkie, and her twin daughters, Tabitha and Loretta. Parker welcomed her children with her husband, Matthew Broderick.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband, Matthew Broderick attend "The Inheritance" Opening Night, 2019, New York City. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>During the 2016 interview, Parker made a particular reference to the impact her relationship with Downey made on her parenting her oldest child, James Wilkie.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" actress explained that when James became a teenager, she asked herself the same questions she had when dating Downey.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She wondered how much she should be doing for her son and at what point she should let her son take the reigns and figure things out on his own. Parker elaborated on her thoughts and <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yMRYReJiPE">said</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"Like, at what point do I let him lose something?

Therefore a person is not aware of what they are learning.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Furthermore, Parker told People that she learned how to take care of herself because she spent a lot of time worrying about Downey and whether he was okay during their relationship.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Besides learning to set boundaries and a few parenting skills from her past relationship, Parker <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/sarah-jessica-parker-robert-down-jr-taught-parenting-skills/>revealed </a>she picked up a few other valuable skills during the relationship:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"I also learned how to balance a checkbook because I had to, and I think those are pretty big things to be learning."</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Robert Downey Jr. arriving backstage during the UFC 248 event at T-Mobile Arena, 2020, Las Vegas. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>After years of worrying and caring for Downey, Parker put these life lessons to use. She finally got the courage to say that she could walk away from the situation, so they broke up in 1991.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Of course, Parker is not the only partner to look back at the relationship. Downey has spoken positively about the couple's former relationship and how "The First Wives Club" actress tried to help him.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>During 2016, Downey appeared on Howard Stern's show and revealed his thoughts about the couple's former relationship and said he did as best as he could under the circumstances.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The "Tropic Thunder" actor stated their <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/robert-downey-jr-reflects-on-his-relationship-with-sarah-jessica-parker-a7015526.html>relationship </a>was "very conservative," even though he was abusing substances and not in his right mind, while Parker was "normal."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Later he explained in an interview with Parade that although Parker disagreed with his drinking and drug problem, she gave him a home, understood, and tried to help him.
