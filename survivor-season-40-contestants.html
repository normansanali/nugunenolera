Season 40 of Survivor is called Survivor: Winners at War. Just like past seasons, it will feature a group of contestants striving to outwit, outplay and outlast their fellow tribe mates in the hopes of winning the cash prize. But this season, it isn’t just about the money (which, by the way, is $2 million for the first time ever). It’s about winning the ultimate bragging rights.</p><p>Which past Survivor winners will be competing in Winners at War?
