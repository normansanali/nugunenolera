布袋さんは当時すでにBOOWYとして活動していましたが、まだまだ無名の存在でありました。
山下久美子さんは布袋さんとの出会いを自身の著書「ある愛の詩」で綴っていました。
彼は百八十七センチという長身を,折り曲げるようにして、そのときスタジオに入ってきた。髪を立て、原宿の古着屋で売っているかのような、黒とピンクのチェックのスーツを着 ていた。お洒落だなという印象だった。
「よろしくっ」 と私。「あ、お願いします」
緊張ぎみに彼は言った。
新作のコンセプトは, ロックンロールな感覚だった。私の原点にもどってまっさらな場所から歌おうとしていた。それにはとびきりのドライヴ感のあるギターを必要とし、それ を探してきたのが、プロデューサーだった。
「すっげえいいんだよっ、ぜひ聴いてみて」
そして、硝子の向こうで彼が最初の音を出した、その瞬間、私は恋に落ちたのだと思う。
すごいっ、なんて音なのっ!
彼のギターには、瞬時に人の心を鷲づかみするかのような、とてつもない情熱があった。 どこかに怒りを含んでいるかのような、哀しみを知るような、それまでに遭ったことのない音だった。
私だけではなく、居合わせたスタッフ全員が色めきたった。やがて、椅子に腰かけ、何やら弾きづらそうにしていた彼が突然、ガッと立ち上がって弾き始めたときには、スタジオ内 が騒然となってしまった。まるでライヴの会場のように。スタジオの中で立って弾くとい う技をやってのけたのは、たぶん後にも先にも彼ぐらいなものだろう。
ついに私は見つけたと思った。欲しかった音を。人を。私のロックン·ロールを。
それからリズム録りを終える約二週間ほどの毎日を、彼とスタジオで過ごした。仮歌を入れるためにブースで隣り合わせたとき、姿は見えないけれど、私たちはすでに互いに惹かれ合っていると、感じた。
彼の音と私の歌は触発し合いながら、溶け合っていった。 なんという心地よさ! 心と声が一致しているのがわかった。久しぶりの興奮と、快感。素の私をとりもどせた。
布袋さんのギターとしての素質に気づいただけでなく、自分とのフィーリングの良さに一目惚れしてしまたそうです。
『心と声が一致している』なんて、かっこいい初対面ですね。
布袋寅泰と山下久美子は出会ってすぐに結婚！子供はなし。格差結婚 布袋さんの最初の結婚は1985年で、当時は23歳でありました。4歳年上の山下さんは27歳ですね。
当時すでに売れっ子だった山下久美子さんと、まだまだ無名だった布袋寅泰さんの結婚は、格差結婚だと取り上げられました。
成功していた山下さんに対して、布袋さんはかなりの嫉妬心があったみたいです。
思えば、私たちはいちばんエナジーを持て余している時期に結婚生活を始めてしまったのかもしれない。
特に若い彼に至っては、嫉妬心においても尋常ではなかった「レッドシューズ」で呑んでいたときに、昔のボーイフレンドが入ってきたというだけで喧嘩になったり、たまたま居合わせた吉川が仲裁に入ると、今度は彼らが殴り合いを始めたりする始末だった。
元彼に布袋さんが怒り、それを止めた吉川さんと今度は殴り合いと、かなり荒々しい新婚生活だったみたいですね。
その後に今井美樹さんとの出会いもあり、ふたりの結婚生活は破綻してしまいます。
山下久美子と布袋寅泰の豪華な結婚式。アン・ルイス、吉川晃司、大沢誉志幸、桑田佳祐が出席
残念ながら離婚してしまった山下久美子さんと布袋寅泰さんですが、当時のふたりの結婚式には豪華なメンバーが集結し、ライブを行って祝福してくれたそうです。
アン・ルイス、吉川晃司、大沢誉志幸、桑田佳祐さんなど、今でも大物のすごい方々です。
このメンツにあって、布袋寅泰さんが無名ギタリストとしてガチガチなのが、ちょっと気の毒ですね。
布袋と山下久美子の破局理由は現在の嫁・今井美樹の略奪愛！元友人の嫌がらせ 布袋寅泰さんと山下久美子さんは1997年に離婚してしまいます。
離婚理由ですが、それは現在の布袋寅泰さんの嫁である今井美希さんの略奪愛だとされています。
実は山下久美子さんと今井美樹さんはもともとは友人でありました。
『彼女と知り合ったのが、いつ頃だったのかはよく覚えていない。初めは私のツアーバンドにいたドラムスのガールフレンドとして紹介された。やがて同じシンガーとして、いくつかの悩みを語り合ったり、時には相談にのったりするようになった。真摯で情熱的な女性だった。
この秋に始まったツアー用のパンフレッドに、友人、知人のひとりとして、コメントを寄せてくれ、そこには「久美子さんのファン、大好きです」と書いてあった。私は少し早く歌い始めた者として、必死でこれからを頑張ろうとしている人の、その率直な発言を、どこかこそばゆい感じで楽しく読んだ。
後に、この人が私の人生に大きく関わってくることなど、夢にも思わずに。
あの頃、彼女から相談を受けていた中には恋愛相談もあった。あるとき「心の中に広がった想いは止められないでしょ」と彼女は言ったのだ。「まあねぇ．．」と答えながら、私の心境は複雑だった。
布袋さんと山下さん自宅に今井美希さんを招いたこともあったほどに、その昔は今井美希さんサイドから山下久美子さんとファンだと言って歩み寄っていたのです。
もともと微妙になっていた夫婦仲。旦那・布袋の人気への嫉妬？ 結婚後も楽曲提供などでファンを楽しませた山下久美子さんと布袋寅泰さんですが、その事が2人の間に微妙な距離を生んでしまったようなんです。
山下久美子さんのライブで演奏することが多かった布袋寅泰さんですが、次第に自分のライブに布袋寅泰さんを目当てでくるお客さんが目立ってきたのです。
まるで地軸がぎしぎしと軋みながらずれていく感じがあった。
それが何なのか、気づくまでに時間はかからなかった。私のコンサートのはずなのに、明らかにギタリスト布袋寅泰目当てで来るファンが増え始めたのだ。
サポートの位置にいるはずの彼が、いつのまにか私と同列かそれ以上になり始めてる。
それは私にとって予想外の驚異だった。不安にかられた。すると彼に対して素直に向き合えなくなり、どこか屈折に近い感情を持ち始めた。
たとえば、BOOWYがチャートのトップにランクインしたことですら、素直に喜べなかった。
布袋さんの実力やパフォーマンスの良さが認められるほどにモヤモヤしていった山下さん、その末にふたりの関係は微妙になっていたそうです。
そのタイミングに現れたのが今井美樹さんだったのです。</description></item><item><title>'Shake It Up' Co-Stars Zendaya &amp;amp; Roshon Fegan Reunite, Look Nothing Like They Used To</title><link>/shake-it-up-co-stars-zendaya-roshon-fegan-reunite-look-nothing-like-they-used-to-89650.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/shake-it-up-co-stars-zendaya-roshon-fegan-reunite-look-nothing-like-they-used-to-89650.html</guid><description>"Swankin wit lil big sis @zendaya at @power_106 with my bro bro @djeman #Elevate #SoBad #ComingValentinesDay," he wrote.
