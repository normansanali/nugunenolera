It follows Chris Pratt in the lead role as Navy SEAL Lieutenant Commander James Reece, a man working to uncover a deep-rooted plot that puts the lives of everyone he loves at risk. It’s action-packed from start to finish, effectively scratching the action movie itch for a range of viewers. The show quickly collected new fans, many of whom already have their sights set on season two.</p><h3 id=h-will-there-be-a-season-two-of-the-terminal-list data-injectable=false>Will there be a season two of The Terminal List?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=993 data-injectable=true>Season one of The Terminal List began development all the way back in 2020, leaving fans to await its release for more than two years. Thus far, reception to the series — and its controversial lead — has been mixed, as reviewers and audiences starkly disagree on the quality of the new Prime series. On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has a 36 percent average Tomatometer score, but its average audience score is leagues higher at 92 percent. The presence of the book behind the series’ author among the production staff likely contributes to far higher opinions among viewers, with Jack Carr as advisor helping the show to remain rooted — at least partially — in its literary origins.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>The show’s dour storyline is largely behind its lukewarm reception among critics, many of whom ping it for both excessive “gruffness” and a “relentlessly grim narrative.” In general, the film seems to be a typical action movie in longer form, tossing in plenty of gunfights and explosions, but offering up little character growth or emotional complexity to ground its military-minded storyline.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Despite this, the first season collected plenty of fans over its 8-episode run. Viewers who enjoyed the classic action vibes of season one are already clamoring for more, and more is almost guaranteed to come. Cleverly released ahead of Independence Day weekend, the film did relatively well in viewership, and is likely to continue to bring in viewers for several months, at least.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Amazon Prime has yet to order a second season of the series, but another season is all but guaranteed. Unless the show’s production costs proved too high for its return, the series is an obvious choice for Prime. Similar action-oriented series like Jack Ryan and Reacher have done well for the service, and The Terminal List offers up similar potential.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>Plus, there are still a wealth of books in Carr’s collection to be adapted. The former Navy SEAL wrote a full four sequel novels in the Terminal List series, and more are yet to come. There’s plenty of potential for several more seasons of The Terminal List, assuming audiences are interested. Given the chatter around the new series, fans can likely expect an announcement of season two within the next few weeks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yku9Slm2asmJp6tbHRpqCnmZxiuaq%2F02aenqxdlnq0scCspqdlYmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dalila-bela.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dalila Bela Fan Casting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blvd-107-02-queens-boulevard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BLVD, 107-02 Queens Boulevard - Forest Hills</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
