It was bittersweet watching the Tuesday, August 2, finale while knowing that on August 1, America’s favorite couple (<b><a href=#>Aubrey O’Day</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Paul “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio</a></b>) appeared to have </span><a href=#>split</a><span>, the second breakup in a three-month period for the couple who originally met on this fabulous reality program.</span></p><p><b>Aubrey Reveals Pauly’s Secret Piercing</b></p><p>Dramatic irony aside, the show managed to end sweetly and with a lot of hope for this group of perpetually single celebs. The show started off with a piece of news that we’ve all been waiting on the edge of our seats for: Aubrey and Pauly <a href=#>finally had sex</a>. Aubrey admitted to her castmates, “We’ve been having a good amount of sex. … He has his penis pierced. It triggers the right spot.” Aubrey always wanted to find her prince charming — guess she’ll have to settle for Prince Albert.</p><p><b>Calum Says Brandi Makes Him Look Like a “C–k”</b></p><p>Later that evening, the group got together for one last hurrah: a party with all of their friends. Tensions rose between <b>Calum Best</b> and <b><a href=#>Brandi Glanville</a></b> as soon as alcohol became involved. Brandi said to the camera, “I definitely don’t trust that Calum isn’t gonna run as soon as this whole experience is over. … Is he even really gonna f–king text me?”&nbsp;</p><p><span>At the party, Brandi played it cool with Calum, who did not respond well. The British hunk lashed out at the mother of two and said, “You shut me down and out like I’m a f–king idiot.” Calum continued, “How the f–k does that make me look? Like I’m a c–k. I’m not here to look like a c–k.” Obviously, Brandi didn’t take too well to this expletive-ridden rant from someone who earlier claimed to have treated her with “the utmost respect.”</span></p><p><b>Brandi Tells Calum to Go “F–k” Himself</b></p><p>Back at the house, Calum took it one step further and began to hit on Brandi’s friend Adrian right in front of her. He played with Adrian’s hair and implied that he wished she were single. Brandi called him out immediately and said, “Go f–k yourself.” Calum clapped back with a “stay single.” Looks like this relationship that never was never will be.</p><p><b>Aubrey Hints at Having Babies With Pauly</b></p><p>The next day at their last group session, Brandi took a dig at Calum when she said, “It’s been so nice to … get to know what I want in a man and what I don’t want in a man.” Meanwhile, Aubrey and Pauly seemed to be wrapping up their time on the show with nothing but hope and excitement for the future. Aubrey even said, “My expectations from here on out are having little blond Italian babies.” Pauly added, “That was the best experience of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Even Six Months After Filming Ended, There Was Still No Sign of Pauly and Aubrey’s Friction</b></p><p>When Dr. <b>Darcy Sterling</b> went to check on Aubly D (R.I.P. their couple nickname) six months later, there was no sign of any imminent breakup. She even pointed out that Pauly had followed Aubrey on Instagram, a stark contrast to split rumors that swirled yesterday and sparked Pauly to erase virtually any evidence of their relationship from Instagram.</p><p><span>When asked on the show what was next for the couple, Pauly answered, “Maybe we move in, maybe talk marriage, a child.” Let’s hope the duo can work it out after Aubrey gets home from her gig in the U.K. as a cast member of<i> Celebrity Big Brother.</i></span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Do you think Aubrey and Pauly’s relationship was ever real, considering their breakup news broke the day before this show’s finale?
