Well, it’s for my husband’s birthday.</p><p>“Remember some time back I said I was gonna pose on Playboy Magazine when I was 75? Well, I’m 75 and they don’t have a magazine anymore, but my husband always loved the original cover of Playboy, so I was trying to think of something to do to make him happy.</p><p>“He still thinks I’m a hot chick after 57 years and I’m not gonna try to talk him out of that. And I hope he agrees. What do you think?”</p><p>After laughing, Dolly explained that she “did a little photo shoot in this little outfit” for Carl’s birthday.</p><p>She added: “I had a cover made of the new Dolly- or the old new Dolly.”</p><p>While holding up framed covers of her previous time on the cover of Playboy, Dolly said she was “a little butterball” on the first one and is “string cheese now.”</p><p>The singer winked at the camera as she said her husband will think she’s “cream cheese.”</p><p>Dolly then explained her plans to surprise Carl by singing to him in her “little bunny suit,” adding: “What do you think? Do you think Playboy should pay me for ought to pay me for this photoshoot? I do.”</p><p>Alongside the clip, she wrote: “It’s always&nbsp;<a href=#>#HotGirlSummer</a>&nbsp;for my husband, Carl 💝</p><p>“Happy birthday my love!”</p><h2>THE ORIGINAL PLAN</h2><p>Back in November, it was reported that <a href=#>Playboy wanted the singer to cover the magazine in celebration of her 75th birthday.</a></p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=#>Playboy</a>&nbsp;exec said: "The magazine would love to shoot Dolly again, and she knows all she has to do is say the word, and it's on!"</p><p>The famed country star first became a cover model for the magazine back in October 1978 when she was 32.</p><p>She donned the iconic bunny costume and showed off her cleavage.</p><p>However, the plan never came to fruition as Dolly turned 75 on January 19 and did not pose for the magazine.</p><h2>POSING 'IN GOOD TASTE'</h2><p>Back in October, <a href=#>Dolly expressed interest in posing for Playboy</a> while appearing on Scott Mills & Chris Stark show on Radio 5 Live.</p><p>When asked if she would pose on the cover, the Jolene singer said: "Yeah, I just might do it, if I can do it in good taste and they want it [and] we'll do it along with a really good interview inside.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"So, yeah, we've talked about it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Dolly</a> continued: "I have been asked, back in the day, but that was so totally not me.
