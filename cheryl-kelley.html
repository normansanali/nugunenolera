In 2003, she began to make paintings of cars using oil on canvas, saying she was drawn by the abstract quality of reflections off the cars' curved surfaces. Around 2008, she began to use oil on aluminum panels. Like traditional photorealists, Kelley bases her paintings on photographs, in this case taken mostly at car shows and automobile museums. However, her technique does not rely strictly on the "mechanical" transfer of photographic images to canvas.</p><p>2003 "Celebration of Contemporary Art," The Woodlands Resort and Conference Center, The Woodlands, TX</p><p>2001 "Sultry," Houston Community College, Houston, TX</p><p>Cheryl Kelley was born in Houston, Texas in 1968.
