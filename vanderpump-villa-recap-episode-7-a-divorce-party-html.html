Wouldn’t you much rather watch him wandering about the provincial fields eating grass, pooping out little pellets, and&nbsp;carousing&nbsp;with his fellow sheep getting ready to be shorn? I know I would. And, bonus, Bernard scored higher on his SATs than Hannah did.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjqs000123b6xigwhoppe@published data-word-count=109>I’m joking, but one of the&nbsp;real&nbsp;problems with the show is that too many damn people work in this villa. There’s about the same number of staff on a season of&nbsp;<a href=#>Below Deck</a>, which this show desperately wants to be, but no one has to drive the villa and ensure it&nbsp;is safely tied&nbsp;to a dock with a bunch of other villas. They don’t even have one bartender on the USS Captain Sandy, but Lisa needs two?&nbsp;Also&nbsp;two events&nbsp;people?&nbsp;She says, “We put a lot of thought into the signature events.” You do?&nbsp;You put all that thought into it&nbsp;and&nbsp;the best you could come up with is a Great&nbsp;Gatsby–themed&nbsp;party, the scourge of Housewives parties everywhere?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjqul00133b6xskxelgsj@published data-word-count=78>As the episode starts, Lisa loses a staff member, Priscilla, who would&nbsp;rather&nbsp;return home than look at the enormous pimple&nbsp;right&nbsp;next to Hannah’s mouth for even one more second. Immediately, she hires a new girl, Nikki, who is giving major&nbsp;<a href=#>Tawny Kitaen</a>&nbsp;vibes. Why do we need her? They did a fine job with Emily, one of the housekeepers, on service with Hannah and Marciano. Also, there are only ever eight guests at a time. How many servers could you possibly need?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjqx900143b6xkrur6wlu@published data-word-count=157>Lisa calls a staff meeting, but she says&nbsp;that she’s&nbsp;too busy to run it, so she deputizes Stephen’s earring to run the show. Eric, who is supposedly the villa manager, is a little bit pissed because he thinks that Stephen is coming for his job. Not quite. He’s so bad that he’s losing his job to Stephen’s earring, which is just there to pick up the pieces. (Those pieces are the&nbsp;little&nbsp;back of a stud that you always seem to lose, but the earring is so&nbsp;big&nbsp;it has 182 of them.) Eric says, “I have to show Lisa I’m doing my job as chateau manager.” Okay, but what is that job? Like, what does Eric&nbsp;do? He doesn’t manage the staff because none of them respect him.&nbsp;He&nbsp;doesn’t seem to&nbsp;be taking much care of&nbsp;the grounds other than corralling the animals.&nbsp;Sure, he looks&nbsp;great&nbsp;flexing shirtless in a mirror, but do you even need Eric? Isn’t Lisa doing the job of a manager quite effectively?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjr0a00153b6xiza0w2qs@published data-word-count=91>That’s what I mean about this show having too much staff. What makes&nbsp;Below Deck&nbsp;great is that the staff has drama that they have to address in between work&nbsp;and&nbsp;the work creates drama on its own. They run those kids ragged! With so many staff members in the villa, none&nbsp;of them&nbsp;are stressed out, and they have plenty of time to do whatever they want.&nbsp;There are no constraints,&nbsp;and&nbsp;constraints&nbsp;always make drama.&nbsp;She should have hired five people and had them running around all day and then shagging all night. That is a show I would watch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjr2y00163b6xafcls9mt@published data-word-count=76>The guest of honor this week&nbsp;is Sara, a woman who just got divorced and wants to celebrate by burning her wedding dress.&nbsp;That is a cute idea, but&nbsp;do you know&nbsp;how many noxious fumes are released by burning sequins? Someone should submit an OSHA violation. Lisa also talks to Sara about why she&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to divorce her husband and makes Hannah listen in, hoping&nbsp;that it&nbsp;will jog Marciano out of her brain for good. The problem is that&nbsp;presupposes&nbsp;Hannah has a brain.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjr7100173b6xfvkg0w7j@published data-word-count=68>That night, when Sara burns her dress, Eric is standing around talking to the guests about how much he hates the party because his divorce was&nbsp;bad. He&nbsp;says to&nbsp;one of Sara’s friends, “I wonder how [her ex] would feel if he knew this was going on.” Who the fuck cares, Eric! The one thing you do not express at a divorce party is regret for the ex. Fuck that&nbsp;dude!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjrar00183b6x93wi4jr9@published data-word-count=128>We see a brief bonding moment between Eric and sous-chef Caroline (again, how many chefs are there on&nbsp;Below Deck&nbsp;for just as many people?) because they’re both divorced, and Eric mentions that his divorce was acrimonious. He says that he and his wife started to have “different opinions,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;he tried to make it work even though she&nbsp;started&nbsp;to hate him. I need to know&nbsp;way&nbsp;more about what&nbsp;really&nbsp;happened, but the way he’s saying it makes me think it is either one of two scenarios. The first is that she got Q Anon–ed or something like that (NXIVM, maybe?), and their different opinions were so unsustainable they had to get divorced.&nbsp;The second&nbsp;is&nbsp;that the differing&nbsp;opinion was that Eric&nbsp;was of the opinion&nbsp;they were in an open marriage&nbsp;and&nbsp;his wife&nbsp;was of the opinion&nbsp;that he was cheating on her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjri600193b6xhjo26esw@published data-word-count=109>The next day, after the party, one of the guests asks for a massage, and Eric goes jogging up to the room to rub all up on a woman named Meghan while she lays on a messy bed next to Sara.&nbsp;Lisa&nbsp;acts&nbsp;like he was trying to sleep with them both, which he could have, but&nbsp;there was someone else&nbsp;in the room.&nbsp;What could have gone so wrong? Also, the logical extension of this format where the staff&nbsp;is forced&nbsp;to hang out with the guests all the time is that someone is going to fuck a guest. It’s just going to happen, and contrary to how she wants us to feel, she is&nbsp;essentially&nbsp;condoning it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjrl6001a3b6xe4s5f4od@published data-word-count=26>After this happens with Eric, she tells him&nbsp;that&nbsp;he will be fixing things around the villa (that’s his job?) and won’t&nbsp;be interacting&nbsp;with the guests anymore.&nbsp;Great. Okay. Fine.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjrns001b3b6x5s5q5xix@published data-word-count=87>At the same staff meeting, Lisa&nbsp;introduces&nbsp;hottie&nbsp;Nikki to make all&nbsp;of&nbsp;Marciano’s nightmares come true.&nbsp;As soon as the meeting is over, Hannah goes outside to find Marciano playing a game of chess on a board left by a giant. She asks if Marciano thinks the new girl is hot and if they’ve hooked up&nbsp;before. Remember, this&nbsp;is the woman who&nbsp;sells herself as secure and all the other women as insecure and jealous. Um, is this how a secure person behaves? Nikki has been there ten minutes&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hannah is threatened. God, she sucks.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjrqt001c3b6xcpcynux6@published data-word-count=72>Marciano knows he’s in a terrible situation because no matter what happens with Nikki, Hannah is going to grind up his balls, overbake them in a croissant, and leave the charred remains on Marciano’s bed.&nbsp;He tells the guys that he’s going to pick a fight with her, saying that Emily should have been promoted and&nbsp;she should have been&nbsp;made a housekeeper, because that is the only thing that will save him with Hannah.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvlfjrtj001d3b6xvk6xev9n@published data-word-count=140>After everyone has been drinking that night, he says exactly that to her when she asks if he’s happy she’s there. His response makes her feel&nbsp;totally&nbsp;unwanted. Hannah then takes her outside with Marciano to talk about it and tells Nikki that she “keeps bringing it up” when Hannah is the one who brought her out there and forced her to talk about it. Now they are fighting for no reason other than&nbsp;booze&nbsp;and the cameras being on. Hannah is screaming, Nikki is crying,&nbsp;Marciano&nbsp;is scratching in his boxer briefs because that’s all he does. Everyone else is hiding and thinking about what a bully Hannah is, considering she has screamed at&nbsp;every single person&nbsp;on staff at this point, of which there are far too many. Fire half of them and let Stephen’s earring run the whole place.&nbsp;Him&nbsp;and Bernard.&nbsp;They’d make an excellent, drama-free team.</p><h3 class=title>VULTURE NEWSLETTER</h3>Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
