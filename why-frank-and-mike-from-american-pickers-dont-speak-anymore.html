After an episode that aired in March 2020, according to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, Fritz abruptly and without explanation stopped appearing on the show. Since TV episodes are filmed months if not years before they air, that means that, as of July 21, 2021, two years have passed since Wolfe and Fritz worked together, looking for treasures around the country. Fritz also revealed in the article that he hasn't connected with his former costar during that time. Fritz also told The Sun that he and his former co-host aren't speaking. "I haven't talked to Mike [Wolfe] in two years," he said, noting that he (Fritz) had a back injury and that at no point during or since his recovery did his old partner call him to ask how he's doing. "That's just how it is," he added.</p><p>Fritz also noted that he believes that cameras and the editors of "American Pickers" pay more attention to Wolfe than him. "The show is tilted towards him 1,000 percent," he said, adding that he was "fine" with his role as the sidekick on the show, the Joe Perry to <a href=#>Aerosmith</a>'s Steven Tyler, as he described himself. He also explained that he believed to have a more down-to-earth appeal than his co-host did.&nbsp;"I'm more of the common man guy," he said to the newspaper. "I haven't found a $100,000 vase or any Michelangelo stuff."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlXBubG9frLW6ecWrmKejXZa7pXnMoqKeZZanvK55wKacq6GTlrtuvMicop6qo2KxsLrTZqqpnZGgeqK62Kamq51f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lenovo-unveils-thinkpad-p52.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8th Gen Core or Xeon, Quadro 3200, and 128GB RAM</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tiara-van-nortwick-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-139404-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tiara Van Nortwick Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
