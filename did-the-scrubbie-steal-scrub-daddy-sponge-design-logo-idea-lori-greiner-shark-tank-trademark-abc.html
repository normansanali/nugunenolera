A cleaning sponge product called The Scrub Daddy is one such product. The founders of this nifty cleaning product not only received Lori's investment but also won the hearts of the fans.&nbsp;</p><p>The founders of another cleaning product- The Scrubbie entered the tank with hopes of raising $100,000 for a 10% stake in their company from a Shark for their cleaning sponge that comes with a faucet or nozzle attachment. The Scrubbie's brand logo instantly rubbed off Lori the wrong way. Both Robert Herjavec and Lori pointed out to the founders of The Scrubbie about how their logo's design bore striking resemblance to The Scrub Daddy's. The font and the style used on the logos were eerily similar.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Scrubbie on 'Shark Tank': What is the cost, who are the founders and is it really a copy of Scrub Daddy?</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Shark Tank': Hairy Grabster's pitch for collecting hair from shower leaves fans 'grossed' and 'disgusted'</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/38ff1dce-ce78-4d97-b69e-5d74e2974654.jpg><p>Lori questioned the founders, Jeff Dakin, Matt Hosey and Tyler Kessler, who came up with the design for their logo and if they honestly didn't notice the similarity in designs. They revealed that their graphic designer came up with it and declared that they never noticed any similarities in the logos. The trio left the tank with no deal from the Sharks, as their sales numbers were extremely low and also the Sharks weren't pleased with the brand's logo. They felt that a similar branding design for two products of the same category is neither good for the brands nor the customers as it could lead to confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Lori and Robert weren't the only people who noticed the similarity in designs between The Scrubbie and The Scrub Daddy. Several fans too pointed it out. A fan tweeted, "It literally was a two sides sponge you can buy at the Dollar Store attached to a faucet/nozzle. With a stolen name and logo #SharkTank."</p><p>"Whoever is watching #SharkTank right now can ageee with me that The Scrubbie is: -a direct ripoff of Scrub Daddy -a POS -operated by 3 absolute morons -the worst presentation ever I wish Mr. Wonderful got angry, honest to god. @ABCSharkTank," pointed out a fan.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It literally was a two sides sponge you can buy at the Dollar Store attached to a faucet/nozzle.
