The 2004 spy-comedy stars Devon Aoki, Sara Foster, Jill Ritchie, and Good as members of an elite squad of spies-in-training who must take down a ruthless villain, played by Jordana Brewster. Directed by Angela Robinson, D.E.B.S. is a fun action-comedy with enough campy moments to keep any viewer entertained.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Deliver Us From Eva</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true>Deliver Us from Eva stars LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union in lead roles, while Good takes on a supporting role alongside Essence Atkins, Duane Martin, Robinne Lee, and Mel Jackson. The romantic comedy follows the perfectionist Evangeline Dandridge, who constantly interferes in the romantic affairs of her three sisters. The only way out seems to be to pay a notorious playboy to date her and keep her occupied, and Eva finds herself swept up in an unexpected romance. The film didn’t score too well with critics, but remains a Black household staple and favorite in the rom-com genre.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8.
