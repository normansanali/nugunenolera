The two had first met when Daym was in between jobs, long before he had made a career out of his food videos.</p><p>Ramyr has been featured on Daym's eponymous channel for years, and he even vlogged their backyard nuptials back in 2012. She's also a fixture on his Instagram feed.</p><p>In 2019, Daym shared a heartbreaking video, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About My Marriage</a>," and he discussed how he wasn't in a great place with his spouse.</p><p>Though Daym and Ramyr had reaped many benefits from his overnight success, the influencer had become much busier as a result. He admitted that he hadn't been focusing enough of his energy on his wife, and that they were "figuring things out."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"There's work that I have to do," he shared. Daym then discussed how things had shifted in his relationship as a result of his professional success.</p><p>"While life is going, what I'm probably not paying attention to is how to deal with life going and who that directly affects..." Daym said in the video, before adding that he was home much less than before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From that video, it may have seemed like Daym and Ramyr were on the cusp of ending their union, and that they had given "all they can give."
