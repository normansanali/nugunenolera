In 1944, she started performing as a part of USO Camp Shows.</p><p>Lynn took her talents overseas, performing in the USO for servicemembers during World War II. She was “thought to be the only American woman to have traveled the dangerous Burma Road during the war,” according to the museum’s statement.</p><p>She moved to New York in the late 1940s and began acting in film, and later, television.
