When it comes to flying, QR codes are becoming increasingly popular and useful.</p><p>QR codes are commonly used in various aspects of air travel. For example, airlines often utilize QR codes on boarding passes. Instead of printing a traditional paper boarding pass, travelers can now simply display a QR code on their mobile devices. This not only saves paper but also makes the check-in process more convenient and efficient.</p><p>In addition to boarding passes, airports and airlines also use QR codes for other purposes. For instance, some airports have implemented QR codes on signage, which can be scanned to provide travelers with additional information or directions. QR codes are also used for e-tickets, baggage check-in, and even in-flight entertainment systems.</p><p>By scanning a QR code, passengers can access a range of services and information. This can include flight details, gate changes, delays, and even special offers or promotions. QR codes can also be used to provide travelers with a seamless experience, allowing them to access a wide array of information and services through their smartphones.</p><p>In summary, a QR code when flying refers to the use of these two-dimensional barcodes in various aspects of air travel. From boarding passes to signage and additional services, QR codes offer a convenient and efficient way for travelers to access information and enhance their flying experience.</p><h3><span id=FAQs_about_QR_codes_in_air_travel>FAQs about QR codes in air travel</span></h3><h3><span id=Can_QR_codes_be_used_for_contactless_check-in>Can QR codes be used for contactless check-in?</span></h3><p>Yes, QR codes can be used for contactless check-in.
