Just about everything related to the chair is adjustable and with many fabric designs and support options to choose from, each chair is truly unique.&nbsp; Compared to other chairs in this market, we would gladly rest our behinds in this chair permanently. Besides – the Plus 8 is made in Sweden (as with all Kinnarps office furniture), and some of the coolest furniture designs come from this area of the world.</p><p>To purchase this chair please e-mail info@kinnarpsusa.com</p><span>Located in Sweden, Kinnarps is one of Europe’s largest office furniture manufacturers specializing in desks, chairs and other related products and dÃ©cor. Luckily there is a distributor here in the US – albeit only one – where you can find some of their great products.</span><p><span>Based on the well proven 600 Free Float and 8000 Sychron range, the Plus 8 <a href=# data-injected=1>office chair</a> from Kinnarps continues the brand tradition of being ergonomically correct and artistically designed. The Plus 8 differs from the 600 Free Float and 8000 Sychron chair in that the arm rests are dynamic, offering even more customizability to the user than previous models. While many people may feel $800 is too much to pay for an office chair, keep in mind that besides looking great, a chair of this quality can actually increase productivity and will last many years.</span></p><p><span>The Plus 8 office chair is constructed using polypropylene and polyamide materials while the seat base is made of recycled polypropylene, reinforced with wood flour to increase durability. The head rest and base are connected via a metal composite. All major components of the chair are made from recycled products and remain recyclable. &nbsp;</span></p><br><span>Everything about the Plus 8 is adjustable, including optional features, making for a potentially expensive product. You can decide to purchase the chair with the optional arm rests and head rest, or you can even buy the chair in leather giving it a more executive look and feel to the overall design. The headrest adjusts fore-and-aft positions, and although the angle can be modified, unfortunately the height cannot be adjusted for taller people. The armrests are height adjustable via a switch located in the front of the arm rest.&nbsp; You can even adjust the lateral position of the armrest by means of the adjusting wheels located under the seat. To adjust the lumbar support, simply press the catch located on the rear of the back rest and you can adjust the backrest to suit. You can adjust the seat forward or backwards to give correct thigh support.&nbsp; Even the chair’s tilt resistance is adjustable to the individual’s body weight. Two unique features we found particularly useful are the Free Float Function – allowing the backrest and seat to follow the movement of the body independently, and the Sychron Function – allowing movement of the backrest relative to the seat (fixed ratio of 1, 5:1).&nbsp; This means when you lean backward the backrest follows while the seat only tilts a little bit, and when you lean forward the seat will move forward with you independently of the backrest.</span><br><span>Our Plus 8 office chair came fully constructed since it came from a local dealer. However should you order this chair over the internet or phone, you can expect the chair to come in about 5 separate parts; the back rest, seat, wheels and base and the arm rests. Construction should take no longer than any other chair; about 10 minutes. The Plus 8 is a very aesthetically pleasing chair and looks like a piece of art in any office setting. Our chair came in a Navy blue fabric, but there are many different colors and styles to choose from, including leather. The Plus 8 feels very firm and unforgiving with its initial setting, so expect to spend some time adjusting its many features to fit your body weight and posture style.&nbsp; The headrest can be positioned perfectly but may be considered too firm for some.&nbsp; Also the armrests could be sturdier.&nbsp; While the armchair offers great adjustability, it unfortunately means there are also more ways for it to accidentally slide out of position.&nbsp; The Free Float and Sychron functions are nothing short of amazing, moving fluidly with your body.&nbsp; Compared to most other office chairs, we found the Plus 8 to be refreshingly comfortable, even after continued use.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The Plus 8 is a very sturdy chair despite its thin and stylish look. Just about everything related to the chair is adjustable and with many fabric designs and support options to choose from, each chair is truly unique.&nbsp; Compared to other chairs in this market, we would gladly rest our behinds in this chair permanently.
