The ads were shot by Mert and Marcus, showing models wearing the iconic white Lacoste polo shirts worn over fancy black eveningwear.</p><p>In 2009, Kebede starred in the film-adaption of the bestselling autobiography Desert Flower by former supermodel <a href=#>Waris Dirie</a>. The film recounts Dirie's childhood in Somalia, her rise to stardom and subsequent awareness campaign against female circumcision. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival and received a standing ovation. Kebede has also had minor roles in The Good Shepherd (2006) and Lord of War (2005). She featured as a 'Face of the Moment' in May 2009's US Vogue.</p><p>Kebede has traveled to Ethiopia to support maternal health projects on multiple occasions. In 2009, she worked with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of their Living Proof Project. Kebede served as a High-Level adviser for the Center for Global Development's 2009 report "Start with a Girl: A New Agenda for Global Health".</p><p>Kebede launched Lemlem, a clothing line, in 2008. Lemlem, which means "to bloom" in Amharic, features hand-spun, woven and embroidered women and children's clothing. Kebede founded the line to help preserve the art of traditional weaving in Ethiopia and to offer work opportunities to local artisans. Lemlem is sold at Barney's, J.Crew, Net-a-Porter.com and numerous boutique shops. Kebede says she hopes this will be part of a sea change for her home country, saying that "It's wonderful to be able to donate and help people".</p><p>In July 2007, with Kebede earning $2.5 million over the previous 12 months, Forbes named her eleventh in the list of the World's 15 Top-Earning Supermodels. The following year, casting agent <a href=#>James Scully</a> likened her to "an exotic Grace Kelly".</p><p>Kebede has served as the WHO's Ambassador for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health since 2005.</p><p>In 2005, Kebede was appointed as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. She then founded the <a href=#>Liya Kebede</a> Foundation, whose mission is to reduce maternal, newborn and child mortality in Ethiopia and around the world. The organization funds advocacy and awareness-raising projects as well as providing direct support for low-cost technologies, community-based education, and training and medical programs. In one health center that the foundation works with, hospital deliveries rose by over 50% in 12 months.</p><p>In 2003, Kebede was named the newest face of Estée Lauder cosmetics, the only Ethiopian to serve as their representative in the company's 57-year history. Her contract was rumored to be worth $3 million. At this time in Kebede's career, she was ranked #1 on models.com.</p><p>Kebede's big break came when Tom Ford asked her for an exclusive contract for his Gucci Fall/Winter 2000 fashion show. Then in May 2002 she was on the cover of Paris Vogue, which dedicated the entire issue to her.</p><p>In 2000, Kebede married Ethiopian hedge fund manager Kassy Kebede. They have two children together: son Suhul (September 2000) and daughter Raee (August 2005). As of 2007, the family resided in New York City. The couple separated in 2013, and divorced in 2015.</p><p><a href=#>Liya Kebede</a> (Amharic: ሊያ ከበደ ; born 1 March 1978) is an Ethiopian-born model, maternal health advocate, clothing designer, and actress.
