Now on its ninth season, the show follows K-1 visa couples as they navigate language barriers, cultural differences, and the pressure to tie the knot on a ridiculously expedited timeframe. With such high stakes, it’s no wonder that even the most well-adjusted <strong><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a></strong>couples end up calling it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the show has managed to spawn some rather resilient couples over its nine-season run, with a handful even going on to build rather impressive families. Regrettably, some of these <a href=#>longstanding couplings have proved so toxic</a> that their longevity has been rendered a point of concern rather than celebration. Here’s a run-down of some 90 Day Fiancé couples who shouldn't be together, but somehow still are.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has 90 Day Fiance Pulled Some Of Its Stars Out Of Poverty?</a></span></p><h2 id=angela-and-michael><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Angela And Michael</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angela-and-michael.jpg><p>When fans first met Angela and Michael on season two of 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days, it quickly became apparent that the two had a rather turbulent relationship dynamic.

The two have constantly found themselves facing backlash from the 90 Day Fiance fandom, with Leida even being labeled one of the show’s worst villains for her cruelty toward Eric’s daughter Tasha.</p><p>Tensions between the couple have been escalating for years, with Eric even having to physically restrain Leida after she threatened to commit suicide at one point.
