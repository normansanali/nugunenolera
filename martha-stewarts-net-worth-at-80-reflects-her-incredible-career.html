If you havenâ€™t seen her on TV, youâ€™ve probably read one of her books or something else sheâ€™s created during her extensive and impressive career. Stewart is now 80 years old and has racked up a pretty substantial CV â€“ and a healthy bank balance too!</strong></p><p>The entrepreneur and businesswoman has started multiple companies under her name and, when she launched Martha Stewart Omnimedia, she became the first American self-made female billionaire. Sadly, over time, the companyâ€™s market cap dropped â€“ but that doesnâ€™t mean she isnâ€™t still doing well for herself.</p><p>Reality Titbit has all the details on Marthaâ€™s net worth as well as how she made her money and her career as a multi-faceted entrepreneur.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV10183Family Reboot | Official Trailer | Disney+https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w8v6hN8F4Kc/hqdefault.jpg10190811019081center22403<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/05/GettyImages-1240247540-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-martha-stewart-s-net-worth>Martha Stewartâ€™s net worth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a> reports Martha Stewart is worth a whopping $400 million. The TV personality has earned this fortune through multiple businesses that are part of the Martha Stewart Brand, which includes TV, magazines and home products.</p><p>Stewart was worth more than a billion dollars at one point but over time the market cap of her company, Martha Stewart Omnimedi, more than halved. Stewart became a billionaire when she and business partner Sharon Patrick secured funding in 1997 to purchase all the television, print and merchandising ventures associated with her brand.</p><p>Despite her losing money, I donâ€™t think she will be complaining about a $400 million bank balance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Martha Stewart (@marthastewart)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=martha-stewarts-impressive-career>Martha Stewartâ€™s impressive career</h2><p>What really kick-started Marthaâ€™s career was when she published her first book.

During her early career she wrote multiple columns and magazine articles and also appeared on television programmes such as The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live.</p><p>A big part of Marthaâ€™s career and one of her proudest moments was when she signed with Time Publishing Ventures in 1990 and launched her own magazine, Martha Stewart Living.</p><p>Stewart also acted as editor in chief of the magazine and it became so successful she ended up having a TV show named after her â€“ Martha Stewart Living â€“ that ran from 1993 to 2004.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching Martha Stewartâ€™s Tag sale is a great antidote to the news. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DNDOlKpWzR</a></p>â€” Laura Moe is over educated and here for the pets.
