She was made famous by the video-sharing website. This young girl quickly became one of the most well-known stars on TikTok as her fan base went through the roof. She currently has 4.3 million Instagram followers and a minimum of 15 million active TikTok followers. So let’s talk about huge figures.</p><p>Madi joined the Not a Content House TikTok club. Later, she broke away from the group and continued on her own. Madi Monroe publishes videos about dance, living, and aesthetics. She also has a YouTube account with 500,000 subscribers in addition to TikTok.

They had announced their romantic endeavors back in January 2023. People who follow Madi on TikTok and Instagram are aware that she frequently makes fun of herself on those platforms. Madi is from Los Angeles, California. But following eight months of dating, Madi and Matthew’s relationship ended, and one TikTok had her followers worried.</p><p>Fans were devastated by the mere hint that Madi and Matthew were breaking up when her video appeared on TikTok. Fortunately, when Madi heard the stories had spread, she said that wasn’t the case. Madi responded to the page’s post shortly after The Tea Talk published her video and refuted any conflict between her and Matthew.</p><p>“Not about Matthew, LMFAO,” Madi commented. “Just a post, Jesus.”</p><p>Many readers questioned why Madi would post about a breakup and expect her supporters not to assume the worst, despite the fact that she said she and Matthew were on good terms.</p><h3><strong>Meet Matt Williams, Madi Monroe Father</strong></h3><p>Madi Monroe thinks that her father Matt Williams is the “coolest dad.”</p><p>Matt is the son of Sally and Arthur Williams.
