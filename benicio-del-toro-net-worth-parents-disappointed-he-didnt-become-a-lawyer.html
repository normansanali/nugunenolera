He actually had dreams of turning professional. "My dream was to play basketball in the NBA. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I fell into acting almost accidentally</a> during my freshman year at university in San Diego," he said, according to New Zealand Herald.

But if you go to college and study acting, that doesn't mean you can make a living. So I've been lucky."</p><p>He has also spoken about how his ethnicity is often seen as a disadvantage in Hollywood. "I fought the stereotype, and I've also been able to use the stereotype to my advantage," he explained.

The neighbors would have called the police plenty of times," he told Esquire of his father.</p><p>"I got whupped by him many times, but I wasn't the only one getting whupped. All of my friends were getting whupped! That's how it was. He would get the belt or get in your f***ing face: 'Ra! Ra! Ra!' The thing about it, was that, had he done that and not been there, that could be a problem. But he was there for every dinner, every breakfast. And I knew that he was right 90 per cent of the time.

He only has one child for now, but when asked if he would ever have another, he told Esquire, "I don't know what the future will bring. I'm not with the mother of my daughter, and we have a good understanding of what happened, and I'm grateful, but if I was having another kid, I would have to be with the mother. I don't want to have a kid just to have a kid.
