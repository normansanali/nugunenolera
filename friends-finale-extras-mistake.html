As hard as it was for the fans to digest, it was even harder for the cast. Even know watching it back, the six friends <a href=#>aren't quite sure how they were able to get through it.</a></p><p>"There was a lot of crying that night," says LeBlanc, "I don't know how we got through actual scenes," Kudrow would also add in.</p><p>Co-creator Marta Kauffman would also add the fact that it wasn't just the end of the show, but it was the end of a ten-year relationship, which is what made everything that much harder.</p><p>"It was not just the end of a series, it was the end of 10 years of relationships. I mean we were really proud of this show, but like anything good we were sad when it was over. This was no longer that time in your life when your friends are your family. You're starting your own family. You don't want them to feel like, "Thank God it's over!" And leaving them wanting more is always a nice thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span></p><p>Throughout its history, the show released 236 episodes in its ten seasons.

At the point, a woman with a headband can be spotted in the background.</p><p>Once Ross and Phoebe head to Newark airport, once again, the same woman with a headband is visible in the background while Ross is at Rachel's gate... did the production crew get lazy... or did this woman end up arriving at the wrong airport as well like Ross and Phoebe?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/friends-airport-scene.png><p>Props to 'Friends' fans for pointing this out - at the very least, maybe the extra could've undergone a wardrobe change.
