The two instantly fell in love with each other and knew he/she was “the one.”</span></p><p><span>According to Stacey, “I knew I found the one in Dalen because I didn’t just love him, I wasn’t just attracted to him, I liked him as a person.”&nbsp; Although being lovebirds, the duo would laugh and talk as friends, and share about everything.&nbsp; “I love his love for his family and especially how he treats and loves on his mother.
