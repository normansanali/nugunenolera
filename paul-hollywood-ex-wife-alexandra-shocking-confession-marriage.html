In 2013, the celebrity chef had an affair with his American Baking Competition co-star, Marcela Valladolid, but reconciled with his wife shortly afterwards. Alexandra, who is a food writer, reflected on their marriage during a chat with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sunday Telegraph</a>, saying: "When you get married and have children, it's easy to lose yourself. I'm not complaining because I was happy, but then someone else rips everything up and it wakes you up to who you are and what you have become and what sacrifices you've made."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27061a2eaaff-paul-hollywood-wife-z.jpg><p id=eKWRMrNQ2KoI data-wc=7><strong>The couple were married for 20 years</strong></p><p id=emUVV3YLOXz5 data-wc=94>Alexandra and Paul were married for 20 years. They briefly split in 2013 after the Great British Bake Off judge's indiscretion came to light; Alexandra received a £1.4million payout. But the couple later reconciled, with Paul, 52, calling his affair "the biggest mistake" of his life. They split for the second time in November 2017. Alexandra previously revealed she stayed with her husband for the sake of their son Josh, 17. Speaking about her decision, the mother-of-one confessed: "I stand by that decision. I believed in my marriage, I wanted to make it work."</p><p id=eCH8k3rO0s0G data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Hollywood's ex-wife Alexandra explains why she went back to him after affair</a></strong></p><p id=eL8cDSKQ9-3y data-wc=90>Despite the split almost two years ago, Alexandra confessed the divorce is still painful. "I'm not going to lie and say it hasn't been difficult, but I'm not broken," she explained. "Divorce hurts. I was married for 20 years. But you keep going." At the time of their split, the former couple released this statement: "It is with sadness that we have decided to separate. Our focus continues to be the happiness of our son… we ask the press and public to allow us privacy during this very difficult time."</p><p id=eDalv61jF4PA data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> Jodie Comer, Sarah Lancashire and Martin Freeman to star in new BBC show - get details</a></strong></p><p id=eMmyr0cZxioT data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRaWdtamhthXmBlWinmq2cYrWwuMuyrqinlGKyuXnWop2eZZGhsrmtzZ2pmmWjnbykt8innmabn6Ozpr%2FSoqanZZ2Wv7O1wKCcaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-scott-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Scott Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./animated.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Movies in the Animated genre</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
