This all started because Page's obsession with Aleister Crowley, leading to the belief that Page was a Satanist. The Led Zeppelin star did have the chance to shut down the rumors completely in the past, but he gave an interesting answer that still left that mysterious door open.</p><p>Page said, "I don't really want to go on about my personal beliefs or my involvement in magic," he told Rolling Stone. "I'm not interested in turning anybody on to anybody that I'm turned on to.

However, fans online have speculated, wondering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if Jimmy Page is a pagan</a>. One user in particular seems to think that Page's beliefs are more agnostic than anything else.</p><p>Andrew Brown wrote on Quora, "If one were to label Page, he or she might call him a “mystic” rather than a pagan but “private researcher” might be an even better description. “Pagan” makes me think of someone who “worships” a god or group of gods and Page seems more agnostic. In modern times, the term has been much associated with Wicca. I read in a magazine decades ago that Jimmy Page was interested in comparative religions - more of a researcher than a ritual practitioner."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-page-becoming-led-zeppelin-red-carpet-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jimmy-page-was-upset-after-robert-plant-tore-up-a-led-zeppelin-contract-worth-800-million-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jimmy Page Was Upset After Robert Plant Tore Up A Led Zeppelin Contract Worth A Rumored $800 Million</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Robert Plant took two days to think about a massive offer, and his final decision was one that left Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin very upset.</span><p>The fans add that Jimmy Page grew tired of answering questions about his religion.</p><p>"I can’t see him getting into rituals and such. For one thing, he grew tired of being associated with the occult and often refuses to discuss the topic with American journalists. For another, I once read an interview where Page thinks he might have seen a ghost at Headley Grange and says he withdrew from the apparition because he didn’t want to encounter “something like that."</p><p>"If that’s the case, I can’t see how he would be engaging in rituals, trying to invoke supernatural entities for magical purposes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Page kept quiet about the matter, it wasn't the only time Led Zeppelin were associated with the devil.</p><h2 id=robert-plant-and-jimmy-page-denied-satanic-messages-in-stairway-to-heaven>Robert Plant And Jimmy Page Denied Satanic Messages In Stairway To Heaven</h2><p>Adding to the controversy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Led Zeppelin had to deal with the rumor of satanic messages in Stairway to Heaven</a>. The facts were out there after Paul Crouch played the record backwards.</p><p>The lyrics said, “Here’s to my sweet Satan/The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan/He will give those with him 666/There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan."</p><p>Robert Plant refused to add to the rumors. He said, "To me it’s very sad, because ‘Stairway to Heaven’ was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that’s not my idea of making music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, Jimmy Page was also quick to turn down the suggestion. He said, “I’m going to go straight back to The Beatles here because there was a time when somebody wrote a thesis about Paul McCartney being dead”.</p><p>He continues, “If you playback the records, I’m being serious here even though it’s crazy, but, if you playback the records there was something that says ‘Paul Is Dead’ and then they started to playback a whole manner of records. Of course, we were going to be main candidates for it, and somebody said, ‘It says my sweet satan in it’, and I thought, ‘Gosh, it’s hard enough writing music one way round'”.</p><p>Not what Led Zeppelin expected to deal with following such a legendary release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqxrcaeZJ2hlGLDpr7YZqOirKShsm7AzmaboqugmrluwMeeZKutnaS%2FtHnOn2ShoaNivbO7waWcppmknrBuvsSloKChn6rAbq7EpaCenqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-lauro.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Lauro Attorney Wikipedia, Wiki, Age, Education, Reviews, Twitter, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chanelle-haynes-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chanelle Haynes Age, Wikipedia, Biography Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
