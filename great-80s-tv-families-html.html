Using the small screen to peek inside the homes of families as varied as the Seavers, the Tanners (two sets of them!), and the Winslows became a winning formula, resulting in more than a few ‘80s kids wishing that they could jump ship and join up with their favorite fictional families. Here are 11 you probably imagined being a part of if you were born in the ‘80s.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-3-0-0@published data-word-count=86><strong></strong><strong>1. The Huxtables, <i>The Cosby Show</i></strong><br>The sprawling Huxtable clan lived in Brooklyn way before it was hip, stuffing their immaculate brownstone to the rafters with an assorted cast of characters, blood-related or not. The Huxtables always seemed to be having a great time together (just take a peek at all those dance-happy opening sequences), but that didn’t stop them from tackling some big issues. Are you unnerved by your dyslexia? A pregnant teen? A tiny tot eager for a new family? The Huxtables had you covered.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-5-0-0@published data-word-count=90><strong>2. The Seavers, <i>Growing Pains</i></strong><br>On paper, the Seavers sound like a prototypical family next door — dad Jason was a shrink, mom Maggie worked at a newspaper, and their four kids were all wacky in various cute and acceptable ways — but beyond all that, a deep coolness lurked. Jason jammed out, Maggie was a tough reporter, and eldest-son Mike had a best friend named Boner. The most appealing element of the Seaver family, however, was their enduring interest in talking things out. What kid wouldn’t want such accommodating parents?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-6-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>3. The Arnolds, <i>The Wonder Years</i></strong><br>Perhaps one of the most purposely and plainly normal families ever put on the small screen. Although the series was set in the ’60s and ’70s, the timelessness of the Arnolds and their interactions with each other (has any television show so perfectly portrayed the relationship between brothers?) kept the series feeling fresh.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-7-0-0@published data-word-count=119><strong>4. The Cunninghams, <i>Happy Days</i></strong><br>The coolest Cunningham wasn’t even a Cunningham — he was a Fonzarelli, obviously — but his de facto membership into the otherwise-straitlaced clan gave them instant cred. It’s not just any family that would let a big-haired biker move in upstairs. But the Cunninghams were not just any family. Endlessly accepting and warm, the Cunninghams are the kind of group who would take in anyone at any time (from the Fonz to Richie’s doofus best buds, Potsie and Ralph Malph) without a second thought. Although <i>Happy Days </i>ruled television in the ‘70s, by the time the ‘80s and early ‘90s rolled around, the Cunninghams were still bent on pulling in new members in endless syndication.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-9-0-0@published data-word-count=90><strong>5. The Ingallses, <i>Little House on the Prairie</i></strong><br>Life on the American prairie wasn’t easy — all that salt pork, all those cold nights, Nellie Oleson — but the Ingalls family made it seem manageable and even, somewhat inconceivably, kind of fun. Based on Laura Ingalls Wilder’s book series of the same name, this television show also peaked in the ’70s, yet offered its distilled look at prairie life via syndication well into the ’80s, charming the decade’s youth with various Ingallses from kindhearted Pa to capable Ma to spirited Laura.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-10-0-0@published data-word-count=73><strong>6. The Tanners, <i>Full House</i></strong><br>Something was always afoot at this full house, thanks to the Tanner clan, their various hangers-on (sorry, Uncle Joey, but let’s be honest here), and endless high jinks. With such a wide cast of omnipresent characters (even Kimmy Gibbler, who could apparently come and go as she pleased), you could count on the Tanners to deliver personalized attention, big fun, and lots of snappy comebacks. They’ve got it, dude.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-11-0-0@published data-word-count=84><strong>7. The Tanners, <i>ALF</i></strong><br>TV’s <i>other</i> Tanner family had one major attribute to recommend them to any and all children of the ’80s: The foursome knowingly took in a foulmouthed, cat-eating, furry alien named Gordon Shumway. On purpose! For four seasons, the Tanners aided and abetted ALF (as their resident alien life-form came to be known) as he hid from the government, tore their home to pieces, and routinely threatened to eat their own cat, Lucky. What couldn’t you get away with in that house?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-12-0-0@published data-word-count=88><strong>8. The Winslows, <i>Family Matters</i></strong><br>Although the Winslows eventually played second fiddle to their nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel, the TGIF anchor remained rooted with the Winslows — literally, as the majority of the series took place in the family home. The blended family gracefully (and amusingly) tackled the normal run of sitcom-y problems, but it was their ability to bond over the weirdo next door that set them apart. Every time Urkel zipped into their kitchen with a nasally yelp of “Did I do that?,” we were all Winslows.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-14-0-0@published data-word-count=85><strong>9. The Keatons, <i>Family Ties</i></strong><br>Hippie parents typically means loose household rules, and although both Elyse and Steven Keaton tried to keep their home-life free and easy, it was the kids who rebelled by staying conservative. Although their politics were diametrically opposed — everyone remembers that Michael J. Fox’s Alex P. Keaton was deep into Reaganomics, but baby Andrew was also molded to be a mini-Republican — the two generations of Keatons were always able to agree on one thing: how much they loved each other.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-15-0-0@published data-word-count=88><strong>10. The Pembrokes and the Powells, <i>Charles in Charge</i></strong><br>Any family that hires Scott Baio to watch the little ones is automatically awesome, but <i>Charles in Charge </i>somehow managed to find two similarly inclined clans (the magic of television). The forward-thinking Pembrokes (and, later, the Powells) probably didn’t expect that Charles would all but become a member of their family, but that’s what happens when you let a wisecracking college student into your life and literal home. After all, he was in charge of their days <i>and </i>their nights.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6571d83f84e5f25679b2db25defe940b-16-0-0@published data-word-count=97><strong>11. The Bowerses and the Micellis, <i>Who’s the Boss?</i></strong><br>Television’s most beloved accidentally blended family (don’t worry, the Bradys still have a lock on the purposeful brand of blending), the Bowerses and the Micellis dealt with all the weirdness of sticking strangers in a single house together with plenty of heart and some big laughs to boot. Eventually joined in a more conventional partnership — though Angela and Tony never did get hitched during the course of the series — the Bowerses and the Micellis still exemplified the kind of modern family that anyone would want to join.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>11 Awesome ’80s TV-Families You Wanted to Join</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgbnyovsSaq2ZwYKh6tcKMn5imoZyesrR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./americas-largest-pizza-chain-is-bringing-back-this-major-discount-after-two-years-eat-this-not-that.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>America's Largest Pizza Chain Is Bringing Back This Major Discount After Two Years Eat This Not</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./xeni-jardin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Xeni Jardin - Vulture</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
