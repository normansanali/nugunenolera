Well, this time, auditionee Trey Louis brought Katy Perry to tears as he revealed he was one of the survivors of the Santa Fe school shooting.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This Trey Louis Bio is all about him.</span></p><h3><b>Santa Fe High School Shooting Survivor Trey Louis On Americal Idol</b></h3><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>American Idol</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season kicked off its joyful auditions on February 19, 2023, but right in the second episode, auditionee Trey Louis arrived with a story that broke many hearts. He said that he was a survivor of a tragic school shooting that took place in May 2018.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“A gunman walked into my school. I was in art room one, he shot up art room two. He made his way to art room one, lost a lot of friends, eight students were killed, two teachers were killed,” the auditionee recalled.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, all three judges were tearful after Trey spoke of the shooting with Katy Perry even breaking down and saying, “Our country has failed us. This is not OK, you should be singing here because you love music.” She also added that Trey will remind people that change is needed before Lionel Ritchie said that events such as the Santa Fe school shooting have been “tolerated for too long.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the other hand, Luke had no comment, but he gave Trey a “yes” and said that he was “perfect.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Trey’s audition, he performed “Stone” by Whiskey Myers for which he received a standing ovation from all three judges. “Ya’ll better sit down, man,” Trey said to the judges later.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A month before the premiere, Trey teased his fans on FB with an American Idol promo clip, captioned, “Yall were one month out from experiencing the greatest thing I’ve ever done. Please tune in on Feb 19th on ABC or Hulu.”</span></p><h3><b>Trey Louis Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Trey Louis was 21 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>American Idol</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Trey Louis Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>American Idol star Trey Louis was born to his parents, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Robert Lemley</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Lori Kathleen Williams</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While we don’t know much about his mother, his dad Robert is an </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Alvin High School </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>graduate who went on to study “Biblical Counseling” at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>College of Biblical Studies</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, “Pastoral and Church Leadership” at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>South Houston Bible Institute</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and “Law Enforcement” at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Alvin Community College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Houston-Downtown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, as of 2023, he works as a Biblical Counselor at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bay Area Ministers of Reconciliation</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and is married to Stacie Lemley (Trey’s stepmother).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Stacie is a High School Teacher at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bay Area Homeschool Academy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his siblings, Trey has three brothers and sisters. They seemed close to the singer and often graced his socials.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His sister, Brett Noto was married to Brooke A.M. Noto.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brother, Brandon Noto was married to Amber Louise Noto. He is a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Texas A&M University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate who went on to become a Councilmember at the City of Santa Fe City Hall.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And sister Courtney Lemley studied Interdisciplinary Studies – B.S. at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Houston</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and worked for Dallas Independent School District.</span></p><h3><b>Trey Louis Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Trey Louis is a full-time mattress salesman. He said that he was a “Sleep Expert” at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mattress Firm</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and a “sales associate” at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Columbia Sportswear</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Also, he has worked at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Taco Cabana</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Trey, he has been asked some weird questions on the job like, “how good can you perform on the bed?” and he had to give them answers like, “Yeah man, this one bounces good.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, Trey is also on his way to becoming a professional singer after his time at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>American Idol</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his education, he last attended Santa Fe school and hasn’t thought about further studies after the dreadful incident. In fact, he didn’t want any attention to himself after the shooting so he stayed away from the media as much as possible.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The only reason he’s breaking the silence now is because of a student (who he didn’t know at the time) who saved his life, Christian Riley Garcia.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“When I first entered into the art room, I had closed the door and held the door handle and leaned all my body weight against it to keep it shut and Christian Riley Garcia raised his hand and offered to come over to the door I was at and take my place at the door,” Lemley said. “Just a few seconds later I saw him go down that’s a very vivid memory of that day that could have been me.”</span></p><h3><b>Trey Louis Girlfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Trey Louis was in a relationship with Grace Sheppard ever since November 14, 2021.
