Things went south after the release of the superhit docuseries The Last Dance. Pippen was not happy with how he and everyone else from the iconic <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Chicago Bulls</a> team were portrayed.&nbsp; Furthermore, Pippen’s ex-wife Larsa Pippen’s relationship with Marcus Jordan added fuel to the beef. However, it looks like their relationship has always been a bit complicated.</p><p>In September 2023, author Rich Cohen released his new book “When the Game Was War”. The book focuses on the legendary 1987 NBA season and the fierce rivalries between future Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Isiah Thomas, and Jordan. It revealed a lot of interesting and unknown off-court details. In one instance, the relationship between the Bulls’ stars and their chemistry was discussed.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Scottie Pippen’s apparent love for </strong><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></h2><p>Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen are one of the best duos the league has ever seen. On the hardwood, the two worked like clockwork. Both stars were great on both ends of the court and the chemistry between the two could not be missed during games. However, it looks like the adoration was not mutual.</p><p>According to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Commentary.org</a>, an excerpt from the book read, “A basketball team is a family, a collective, a series of alliances, relationships, rivalries, and triangles. Horace Grant loved Scottie Pippen, who loved Michael Jordan, who also loved Michael Jordan.”</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY</strong> – <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Billionaire Michael Jordan Suffers As $29 Million Worth Chicago Mansion’s 10-Year Struggle Prolongs</a></strong></p><p>The author clearly states Pippen loved Jordan. However, it looks like MJ did not reciprocate it. Or, it could be a dig at Jordan’s possibly excessive self-love.</p><p>Notably, Grant and the 5x NBA MVP did not have a great relationship either. During their time together as teammates and after. Jordan accused Grant of leaking details to The Jordan Rules‘ author Sam Smith. Grant denied the allegation and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>came back swinging</a>. Nevertheless, The Last Dance has made MJ and Pippen’s relationship irreparable.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Scottie Pippen did not hold back in his memoir</strong></h2><p>Scottie Pippen talked about the 1987 NBA season when he entered the league in his 2021 memoir Unguarded.&nbsp;Notably, Pippen called his time with the Bulls the most rewarding. He also noted that it was magical to be a part of the iconic team as every player came together as one. So, when Michael Jordan took center stage in The Last Dance, Pippen was unhappy.</p><p>He expected more from the series like rare footage and relatively unknown information. The 6x NBA champion could not wait for the release only to be disappointed. He also noted that Jordan was fixed to prove to the younger generation that he was larger than life during his day and still larger than <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>LeBron James,</a> as per GQ.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nba-legends-basketball-news-perspective-from-scottie-pippen-to-horace-grant-michael-jordans-friends-turned-foes-listed-from-bad-to-worse?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200406194005/130924113026-michael-jordan-scottie-pippen-flu-game-092413.1280x720-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">From Scottie Pippen to Horace Grant: Michael Jordan’s Friends Turned Foes Listed From Bad to Worse</p></a><p>What are your thoughts on His Airness not reciprocating the reported love shown by Scottie Pippen?
