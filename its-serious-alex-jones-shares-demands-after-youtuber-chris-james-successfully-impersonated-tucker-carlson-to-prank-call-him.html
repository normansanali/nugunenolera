He said he was “caught off guard” by how well his prank worked, and then he said, “It will be on the Monday episode of my show for anyone wondering.” The responses started pouring in, and it sounded like James was getting cold feet. “[People] keep commenting about me getting sued and how I should talk to lawyers. Best shut up or you’ll talk me out of posting it!” he said. This weirdly didn’t stem the tide.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>“Okay too many retweets and replies, starting to stress me out. Muting notifications and hoping I don’t end up on the news.” Hmm, about that. It seems like at his heart, James is an artist who just wants people to enjoy his content. He does also seem genuinely surprised at all the attention he’s getting.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>“This [stuff] blew up so much more than I expected and now I’m stressed that people will be let down, and that they are expecting something in their head that the call won’t live up to.
