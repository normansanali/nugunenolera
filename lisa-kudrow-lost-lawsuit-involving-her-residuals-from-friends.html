Camille Cerio is suing the actor for breach of contract and claims he owes her commission for managing his career."</p><p>"LeBlanc maintains he has paid Cerio more than $200,000 (GBP100,000) in payments, but in a lawsuit filed at Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month (2Jul08), Cerio claims the amount is nothing compared to his royalties from Friends and spin-off Joey. Cerio claims that LeBlanc agreed to cut her 15 percent from all the pilots, but stopped paying her in 2000."</p><p>Unlike Lisa Kudrow was forced to pay her former manager, it doesn't seem like LeBlanc was found guilty of the claims.
