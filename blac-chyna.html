Their daughter was born in November 2016. In December 2016, Kardashian announced on his Instagram post that he and Chyna split. They reconciled a few days after but separated again in February 2017. In July 2017, he posted sexually explicit photos of Blac Chyna onto social media.

In December 2013, she launched her online boutique entitled "88fin", filled with new clothing and products from her clothing line of the same name.

The couple split in 2014 when he began a relationship with <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>.</p><p>Chyna began stripping in Maryland to pay for her college tuition. While attending Johnson & Wales University in Miami, Florida, she resumed stripping and was too exhausted to attend classes. She dropped out after repeatedly falling asleep in class, focusing instead on stripping and modeling. She borrowed the name "Blac Chyna" from a customer. While stripping at a popular Miami club, her exotic look made her popular; radio host <a href=#>Angela Yee</a> described her as looking "like someone who was going to be famous." In 2010, Drake name-dropped her in "Miss Me". Her rising popularity led to modeling jobs on the covers of Dimepiece, Straight Stuntin and Black Men's Magazine. Later in the same year, she was cast as Nicki Minaj's stunt double in the song "Monster" by Kanye West.</p><p>Angela Renée White (born May 11, 1988), known professionally as Blac Chyna, is an American model and entrepreneur.
