Moreover, her last post was a simple single picture of the rapper laying peacefully on a sofa and showing off her body. Now, it seems like she got some more wonderful snaps from that little photoshoot to share with fans, and people unsurprisingly hyped her up in the comments. JT of City Girls fame, Kim Petras, Chlöe Bailey, and more sent her admiring messages and compliments. Such commotion and praise on a regular social media post just goes to show how beloved Nicki is these days.</p><p>However, it's not like that praise hasn't come with a fair share of controversy and conflict. For example, her husband Kenneth Petty <a href=# rel>failed to attend a mediation concerning his sexual assault case</a> due to health reasons. While sickness is understandable, it's the third extension of said mediation this month. As such, many fans are suspicious and critical of Minaj's support, even though external reports can only do so much to illuminate a case like this. Despite that, she seems to have sidestepped accusations of harassment against her, so the criticism mainly came against her partner.</p><span><h2 id=h-nicki-minaj-brings-the-heat-in-new-thirst-trap-post>Nicki Minaj Brings The Heat In New Thirst Trap Post</h2></span><p>Still, Minaj has had an incredibly successful past few months thanks to high-profile performances and singles. For example, her most recent single "<a href=# rel>Red Ruby Da Sleeze</a>" garnered much attention and acclaim for various reasons. One of those is apparently shading <a href=# class=text-word rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> and Latto <a href=# rel>through subliminal bars on the record</a>. Sure, some people want more from their songs than the typical rap beef, but the 40-year-old had bars to spare. In fact, if you weren't a fan of that track, chances are her previous singles will catch your attention even more.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pinkprint MC also had a recent crossover into the on-screen world. Moreover, her track "Super Freaky Girl" appeared as the soundtrack for the <a href=# rel>trailer for No Hard Feelings</a>, Jennifer Lawrence's upcoming comedy. Perhaps this hints at more extracurricular endeavors from Minaj in the future. But of course, it wouldn't be her first film foray, and she can bank on the impact of her music. Regardless, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Nicki Minaj.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYJxgZZmpaKbm556rrXNmqFmo5WavbR506GcZqyYnr%2B0wIytqZqoo2KwsLnIp55mr5mptW65zqucZqunnrq0wcitZKmhk6nCs7HS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./owen-joyner-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Owen Joyner Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-sussman-family-wife-children-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-him.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Sussman: Family, Wife, Children, And All You Need To Know About Him</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
