"I mean, how could you not? He's charming, he's brilliant, and he's a beautiful human being inside and out who is constantly running around in his underwear making people laugh."</p><p>With that being said, there is still a lot to be said about this beautiful friendship.

The original storyline would revolve around Jesse's death and how Walt evolved into Heisenberg as a way to cope with the loss, but the actor did an astounding job to convince everyone that he deserved to stay. Bryan, however, would go on to make pranks into thinking that Jesse would be killed off soon.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He would say, 'Hey, did you read the next script?</a>'" the Need for Speed actor recalled in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
