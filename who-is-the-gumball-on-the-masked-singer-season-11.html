The body also features their coin slot and crank, while they also have yellow robotic arms and legs.” While his costume is nothing short of spectacular, his powerhouse vocals are sure to knock your socks off as well, with a clip of him belting out a big note circulating on TikTok.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>An expert Masked Singer and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claim to Fame</a> decoder named @carpoolkyleoke took to the video sharing platform to share who he thinks The Gumball might be, and he might have hit the nail on the head.

I’m getting a little Broadway vibes from him, but he’s also really confident. I mean, in the preview, he’s like, ‘I’m taking everyone down.’ He acts like he’s here to win, and of course, the internet already has its thoughts about who is under the Gumball mask.”</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>He then proceeded to share who people believe is The Gumball, juxtaposed with who he personally believes is behind the mask:</p><p>“People think it could be Jensen Ackles from Supernatural, or even Adam Lambert, but I personally think this aca-awesome voice could belong to <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Skylar Astin</a></strong>. I feel like the tone is there. He has that kind of musical theater quality to his voice. Skylar has done other shows like Lip Sync Battle and Match Game, so it feels like he would do Masked Singer. What do you think?”</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>For those who are unfamiliar, Astin has a stellar singing voice, best known for starring as Jesse Swanson in the Pitch Perfect franchise. He also is no stranger to the stage, being a part of productions in the past, including (but not limited to) Spring Awakening, Rent, West Side Story, Into The Woods, and Little Shop of Horrors.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Could his next gig be on The Masked Singer stage? We will just have to wait and see how his stint on the show, or lack thereof, unfolds…</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to see the first unmasking of the season, be sure to tune into FOX tonight (March 6) at 8pm ET/PT for the premiere of The Masked Singer season 11.
