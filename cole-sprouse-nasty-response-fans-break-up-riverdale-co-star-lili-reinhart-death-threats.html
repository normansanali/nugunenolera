Vulture</a>, Cole admits things got so bad that angry fans were contacting his family and even making threats against his life. “I get a lot of stuff sent to my house or my loved ones’ houses,” the former Disney star shared. “Death threats, really nasty, honestly criminal stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cole has played Jughead, while Lili has played Betty since Riverdale’s first season, which debuted in 2017. Their onscreen characters soon became romantically involved, making them fan-favorites.</p><p>The hype around Betty and Jughead’s romance was further fuelled when Cole and Lili began dating in real life later in 2017, much to the delight of fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Cole Sprouse Is Really Like To Work With, According To Lana Condor, Lili Reinhart, And His Various Co-Stars</a></span></p><p>However, the pair ended their relationship in 2020 after being on and off for three years, though their characters continue to be an item in the series. But based on Cole’s recent comments, it appears some fans can’t accept that Cole and Lili have moved on.</p><p>“Is that just a consequence of an incredible love? Or is that what fanaticism looks like,” Cole continued. “Perhaps because those lines were blurred to our audience, it’s hard to break those things up when life moves on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-cole-sprouse-and-lili-reinhart-broke-up>Why Cole Sprouse And Lili Reinhart Broke Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cole-sprouse-and-lili-reinhart-relationship-flying.jpg><p>Despite intense fan speculation, Cole and Lili have been relatively tight-lipped when it comes to the details of their break-up. Lili made a reference to it in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2020 when speaking to Refinery29</a>, explaining it was one of the most difficult experiences of her life.</p><p>“I couldn’t see the light. I was like, ‘I feel like I’m dying.’ It was f—king rough, and there’s no other way through it than just through it,” she said, referring to it as a “black tunnel” that she thought was “never going to end.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, in March, Cole discussed how difficult it was to still have to film with Lili for years following their split – Riverdale just wrapped up filming its final season in June. “It was hard to suspend all the way we felt about each other and it didn’t afford us the luxury of distance to really overcome that,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said during an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast</a>.</p><p>“I know we both did quite a bit of damage to each other,” he added.</p><p>Reports in 2020 suggested that Cole and Lili’s break-up was fuelled by distance caused by the COVID-10 pandemic.</p><p>"Distance is never good for their relationship. They decided not to quarantine together and knew off the bat that it wasn't going to work," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told E! News at the time</a>.</p><p>Although Riverdale fans may not be over Cole and Lili’s IRL break-up, the two have publicly moved on from each other. Cole has been romantically linked to Ari Fournier since February 2021, while Lili went Instagram-official with her new boyfriend, TikTok star Jack Martin, in April.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqKSVYsCxvs6uqp5lnpbAtcWMq5ysqJ%2BjwKZ5xZqlrGWSp7Kit4yup2aqmauys7DApZxmm59iwLWt0WajoqSZYr%2Bmtc2hmKusXZmyosDHZquhqpWWwbR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-radcliffe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Radcliffe: News and Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brianna-hildebrand-height-and-weight-measurement-in-meters-feet-kg-and-lbs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brianna Hildebrand height and weight Measurement in meters, feet, KG and lbs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
