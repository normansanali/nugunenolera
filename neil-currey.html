It brings joy and despair into one‚Äôs life. It can be challenging sometimes to navigate life for everyone at one point or another. But it can be particularly hard if you also fight an invisible battle with the darkness within. The exhausting, never-ending fight with the demons of the mind can weigh you down.</p><h2>What happened to Neil Currey?</h2><p>He ended his life due to mental health issues. It is crucial to seek help from mental health professionals and refuge in trusted loved ones. A kind word from a loved one can heal a thousand wounds. But in the case of Neil Currey, maybe his wounds were too deep to heal by mere words. He lost his battle with darkness and ended his life to break free from what deeply troubled him.</p><p>Milo Sarcev, his former coach and friend, broke the news of his untimely demise on his social media post that said,</p><p>‚ÄúAbsolutely shocking, heartbreaking news ‚Äì that my former athlete&nbsp;@neil_currey&nbsp;died today‚Ä¶taking his own life. üòî My last/best memory of him was this smiling face after he won New York Pro and fulfilled his lifetime dream of qualifying for the Mr. Olympia.
