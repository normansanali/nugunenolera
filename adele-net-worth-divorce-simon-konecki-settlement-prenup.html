The two began dating in 2011 before welcoming their now <a href=#>10-year-old son, Angelo</a>, in October 2012. “I definitely chose the perfect person to have my child with. That – after having a lot of knee-jerk reactions — is one of my proudest things I’ve ever done.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele filed for divorce in 2019, after eight years together.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When tabloids broke the news, it was reported the pair had been married for three years, since 2016. However, in 2021, Adele revealed they got married in 2018. Meaning, that when she announced her divorce, they had only been<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> husband and wife for less than a year</a>, "We got married when I was 30... then I left."</p><p>Unlike most celebrity marriages ending with messy divorces, Adele and Simon's split was amicable. According to the Grammy winner, they just grew apart. “She became a bigger and bigger star, and he was okay [with] being in the background, but as she got bigger and had massive tours and intense schedules, they just grew apart.” There had been rumors their relationship was over as early as 2014 when news came out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were living in separate homes.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since they did not sign a prenup before marriage, Simon was legally entitled to half of everything she earned during their time together. Simon could have reportedly walked away with close to $180 million. By 2018, Adele's net worth had jumped from $69 million to $182 million thanks to her successful Adele Live tour, which grossed a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">167.7 million in ticket sales alone.</a></p><h2 id=adele-and-simon-konecki-reached-divorce-settlement-in-2021>Adele And Simon Konecki Reached Divorce Settlement In 2021</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adele-at-the-brit-awards-2022-1.jpg><p>In 2021, a judge ordered Adele to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pay a majority of the $190 million divorce settlement</a> to her ex-husband, Simon Konecki. The couple agreed to have a mediator help them split Adele's fortune in terms of property and debt, meaning Simon likely walked away with a significant chunk of Adele's net worth. Exact details about how much money Adele ended up paying Simon were kept under wraps, after the singer requested the judge to seal court documents from the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Adele would not have to pay the charity CEO any child support, as they would share joint physical and legal custody of their son. After her divorce, Adele began building her new life as a single woman and slowly began finding out a new side of herself. At first, it was hard and Adele kept to herself a lot, but her friends stepped in with all sorts of ideas of how she could enjoy the new chapter in her life.</p><p>The singer-songwriter reportedly did everything from traveling, going on retreats and <a href=#>hitting the gym to reduce her anxiety </a>and be better for her son Angelo. And it worked. Not only did she transform her body in the gym, but she also got back into dating. But dating in Los Angeles was horrible for the singer, and she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she joked that she only lasted five seconds in the LA dating scene</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/adele-had-a-troubling-relationship-with-her-father-but-they-finally-found-peace-before-his-passing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Adele Had A Troubling Relationship With Her Father, But They Finally Found Peace Before His Passing">Adele Had A Troubling Relationship With Her Father, But They Finally Found Peace Before His Passing</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Although Adele had a troubling relationship with her father throughout her life, the two finally found peace before he passed away.</p><p>“Everyone is someone or wants to be someone. I've been so lucky that no one I've been with has ever sold a story on me. I feel like that could really be a possibility.” Luckily, Adele found love with NBA agent, Rich Paul, who manages athletes like LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green. Paul and Adele met at a birthday party before embarking on what she describes as "the easiest, incredible and open-hearted" relationship she has ever been in.</p><p>The two caused a storm in July 2021 when they sat together at an NBA game. At the time, Adele told Elle Magazine, she's obsessed with Paul and definitely has plans to have more kids. “I'm a homemaker, and I'm a matriarch and a stable life helps me with my music.”</p><p>In June 2022, Rich proved he was on the same page as her, saying he is looking forward to becoming an older father. “If I was to have more kids, I'm looking forward to being a different dad, a more patient dad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-adele-39-s-marriage-to-rich-paul-is-different>How Adele's Marriage To Rich Paul Is Different</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Adeles-Rocky-Relationship-Reportedly-Caused-Axed-Vegas-Shows.jpg><p>Going into this <a href=#>relationship with Rich Paul</a> after all she had been through with her first husband, Adele knew she had to do things differently. The couple has managed to keep their relationship private despite being spotted in public several times and referring to each other publicly as husband and wife. When Adele attended Alan Car's comedy show, she spilled the beans and confirmed she was married to the NBA agent by raising her hand when he asked who in the crowd was married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adele was particularly happy to shout to the world that she had married the love of her life, unlike her first marriage that she kept under wraps. Another decision she made differently was to have Rich Paul sign a prenup to protect her fortune before they tied the knot. According to CelebrityNetWorth, the “Someone like you” is worth $220 million, which she has made from her album and digital song sales and her 2023 Las Vegas Residency.</p><p>“She believes in love, and she says talking about anything to do with money is a sure-fire romance killer. She was right. It was a touchy subject.”</p><p>Rich Paul also has his own fortune to protect, as he is estimated to be worth $120 million, but he was not happy when Adele brought up the prenup. A source close to the duo revealed Adele's friends encouraged her to get the documents in place before she said ‘I do’ even though it ended up causing some friction in her new relationship. Nonetheless, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele and Rich Paul's prenup exists</a>, so if anything happens in their marriage, both of their finances are protected, unlike what happened in Adele's first marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZ2cmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16pbXVqKmcnV2otq67zWaiqKaVmLiqedKeq62klaKyr8CMqamepqWlfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adriana-lima-shuts-down-plastic-surgery-accusations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adriana Lima Shuts Down Plastic Surgery Accusations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-gacha-gumball-machine-locations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Gacha Gumball Machine Locations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
