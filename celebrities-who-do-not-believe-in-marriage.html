From being focused on work to experiencing a bad marriage, there are many reasons why marriage has taken the back seat today. Celebrities are not far behind in having their opinions straight and <a href=#>direct about never wanting to get married</a>. Many celebrities have been in long-term relationships for decades but enjoy the way things are, while others are scared of what the future holds or prefer not to repeat the mistakes from the past. From Oprah Winfrey’s 36-year relationship to <a href=#>Drew Barrymore’s apprehension as a single mother</a>, let’s look at the celebrities who say they are never getting married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Oprah Winfrey</span></h2><p>Oprah Winfrey has been dating Stedman Graham since her show debuted on television in 1986. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham proposed to Winfrey, and the pair even got engaged in 1993</a>.

The actress believes they have set a high precedent in her life that remains unattainable. Ryder has been in a relationship with Scott Mackinlay since 2011 but prefers to remain single rather than get a few divorces.</p><h2 id=allison-janney><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Allison Janney</span></h2><p><a href=#>Allison Janney</a> last dated Richard Jenik before they split in 2006.

After their divorce, she married Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, before they separated.
