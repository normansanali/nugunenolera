That’s the whole point. However, there are redeemable and entertaining villains, which we love to hate, then there are the lowest of the low. These horror villains are beyond despicable and vile, truly giving the genre a bad name for all the wrong reasons.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>They make our skin crawl, our blood boil and send our gag reflexes into overdrive, but aren’t those qualities the makings of a true, ferocious villain? Regardless, Reddit believes that some horror villains are beneath forgiveness and aren’t simply misunderstood, but rather completely evil through and through. They are so evil, in fact, that these fans want to fist fight them in a Walmart parking lot — which is oddly specific. Without a doubt, these horror antagonists are the most hated of them all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Horror Movie Villains you hate the most.</a> from <a href=#>horror</a></figure><p data-characters=793 data-current-count=1093 data-injectable=true>Right off the bat, we have The Invisible Man‘s (2020) Adrian Griffin, played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen. Although Cohen was a beloved addition to Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House, he wasn’t so welcomed as Adrian in Leigh Whannell modern-day rendition of The Invisible Man (1933). Adrian is abusive to Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) and consistently belittles and mocks her, essentially keeping her prisoner in her own home. He fakes his death only to torment and antagonize Cecilia, seeking to teach her a lesson about running away, despite her having every reason to leave him. If that isn’t pure-bred evil, nothing is. Plus, Adrian carries a certain smugness and egotism that just makes him all the more villainous. Props to Cohen, however, for playing the role perfectly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>moon-456’s comment from discussion "Horror Movie Villains you hate the most."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=910 data-current-count=1210 data-injectable=true>Next up, we have Martin, whom everyone remembers (and tries their hardest to forget) from The Human Centipede sequel that never should have happened: The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). Martin is portrayed by Lawrence R. Harvey, whose face has become synonymous with The Human Centipede franchise — a mascot of sorts. In the sequel, Martin is an obese, mentally challenged security guard with an obsession for the first Human Centipede film (which exists and is referenced in-universe for a clever fourth-wall break). To fuel his obsession, Martin reenacts the events of the first film, attempting to replicate the grotesque sequence with even more people. He succeeds, but the result is horrifying, and there’s a rape scene involving Martin, which just proves how much of a low-life he really is. He’s so irrelevant, in fact, that Reddit even refers to him as “the short fat guy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>MichaelMyers1980’s comment from discussion "Horror Movie Villains you hate the most."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=843 data-current-count=1143 data-injectable=true>As if Martin weren’t enough, Reddit also nominates Samantha Sloyan’s Bev Keane from Midnight Mass, a Netflix horror miniseries that centers on an isolated island that experience supernatural events after the arrival of a priest. Mike Flanagan (Doctor Sleep) directs with his wife Kate Siegel (Hush) starring as Erin Greene, which is all the convincing you’ll ever need to check it out. Unfortunately, Midnight Mass features a well-hated villain in Bev Keane, described as “a zealous and overbearing member of St. Patrick’s Church and an influential figure in the community.” She’s hypocritical when it comes to everything that religion stands for, so not only does she give unwavering faith a bad name, but she’s just plainly annoying. Sometimes, an irritating villain is worse than a cruel one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>GreenBook1978’s comment from discussion "Horror Movie Villains you hate the most."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Those are just a handful of the nominations, but Reddit has infinite suggestions to offer up.

Not only are some of them influential and powerful, but some, like Martin, are built to withstand anything. That’s the nice way of putting it, anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnKydXZa%2FpnnToZxmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjK%2BgpaSRnru0edOhmK1llpa7tHnWmqWtZaSkeqe10q1kn6GXncFutc1mmGavkaG6or7TZqeaqpueu6h5y6iraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./union-county-public-schools.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Weddington High School - Matthews</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ecs-liva-q3d-and-acemagic-t8-plus-micropcs-review-jasper-lake-and-alder-laken-in-a-smallerthanucff-package.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>System Performance: Miscellaneous Workloads - ECS LIVA Q3D and ACEMAGIC T8 Plus micro-PCs Review: Ja</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ilia-kulik-net-worth-151712.html>Ilia Kulik Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kyle-thousand.html>Kyle Thousand- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nate-richert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634144-html.html>Nate Richert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sean-caracena-from-kid-90-who-is-he.html>Sean Caracena From Kid 90: Who Is He?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tameka-harris-net-worth-187338.html>Tameka Harris Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogN.
