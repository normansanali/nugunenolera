Let us get to know more about the life of Jill Freeze.</strong></p><p>Jill Freeze is married to Hugh Freeze who is an American football coach.</p><p>Hugh Freeze Jr. is the current head coach of the Liberty University football team in the United States. Freeze began his coaching career as the head football coach at Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, where he taught NFL stars like Michael Oher and Greg Hardy.</p><p>From 2008 to 2009, he coached the teams of Lambuth University, Arkansas State University, and the University of Mississippi, also known as Ole Miss, from 2012 to 2016. College football fans are curious to learn more about Hugh Freeze outside of the field, particularly about the woman in his life, Jill Freeze.</p><p>Jill Freeze is a mother of three teenage daughters with her husband and is a significant supporter of her husband’s coaching career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hugh-freeze-wife-jill-freeze></span>Hugh Freeze Wife Jill Freeze<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jill Freeze was born into a Christian household in Louisville, Mississippi, in the United States.</p><p>Though little is known about her early life because she rose to prominence solely as a result of her husband’s achievement, the latter half of her life has not been as obscure.</p><p>Jill was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, where she graduated from high school. She went on to get a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Secondary Education from the University of Southern Mississippi after graduating from high school.</p><p>She also has a master’s degree in secondary education. Jill worked in the education sector for eleven years after finishing her studies, teaching numerous high school grades. Today, Jill Freeze feels compelled to reach out to other football coaches’ wives.</p><p>She devotes the majority of her time to this cause and the organization she co-founded with her spouse. Jill Freeze shares her faith with her followers on social media through Bible passages and inspirational words that she posts from time to time.</p><p>Hugh Freeze is also active on Twitter under the handle&nbsp;@CoachHughFreeze.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hugh-freeze-wife-jill-freeze-children></span>Hugh Freeze Wife Jill Freeze Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jill Freeze And Hugh Freeze are the parents of three children.</p><p>Hugh and Jill have been together since July 1992. The pair met at the University of Southern Mississippi when they were both undergraduate students. The couple did not fall in love at first sight, but they grew to love each other over time. On July 25, 1992, they married at a Baptist chapel in Independence, Mississippi. They then went on their honeymoon to Gatlinburg, Tennessee.</p><p>Ragan, Jordan, and Madison are their three adorable daughters.</p><p>Every member of the family is a sports fanatic. Even the oldest daughter, Ragan participates in volleyball. She is active on Instagram under the username&nbsp;@raganfreeze.</p><p>Because the head coach likes a private existence, little information about their family is available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yhrKCgXZu%2FprHZnmSwoZaaequ1y6Vkn6qVmsemecSvnKuxpJ22r7OMraZmo56kxG6twaisrWWknbJur86amqGdo6h6rbvVnmSloZaaenN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-wins-special-forces.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Wins 'Special Forces: World's Toughest Test'?
