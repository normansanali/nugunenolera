But Gabbard has not always had the easiest path to the senate. A shy kid during her high school years, Gabbard is a former military officer and is against military intervention and America’s role as a police officer. But despite her love for the military, Gabbard has been haunted by her time in the army. It was during her deployment to Iraq that Gabbard’s relationship with her then-husband, Eduardo Tamayo stretched ultimately leading to the pair’s divorce. But for all his early association with Gabbard, not much is known about Tamayo. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Eduardo Tamayo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Eduardo Tamayo?</h2><p>Eduardo Tamayo is a businessman and former husband of Tulsi Gabbard who is a politician and former United States Army Reserve officer.&nbsp;While the man himself has gone incognito and removed all the traces from the media still he found himself the media attention because of the spousal relationship with Tulsi Gabbard.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bits and pieces:</h2><p>Eduardo Tamayo is said to be born in 1981 in Hawaii, U.S. Not much is known about Tamayo’s early life. While there is no concrete proof about his family members, several articles report that Tamayo has an uncle, Toby Tamayo, in the Philippines who is also a yoga guru. It is also reported that Toby’s father, Tamayo’s grandfather is Antonio Tamayo who served as a Philippine General and survived the horrific Bataan Death March during the second world war. If proved true, then it is safe to say that Gabbard is not the only person with military associations in the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eduardo-Tamayo-ex-wife-Tulsi-Gabbard.jpg><p>Not much is known about Tamayo’s education and details on his career continue to remain a mystery. When he was together with Gabbard, it was reported that Tamayo was self-employed. But details on Tamayo’s business remain a secret.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship with Gabbard and Marriage:</h2><p>Tulsi Gabbard and Eduardo Tamayo have known each other all their lives. If the tabloids are to be believed, the pair are childhood friends and have known each other since elementary school. Regardless, the pair tied the knot when Gabbard was 21. The ceremony was held in 2002 in front of a justice of the peace and family members. Talking about her first wedding Gabbard <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>revealed</a>,</p><p>“I was more into martial arts than Barbie dolls, so it never crossed my mind to think about what kind of wedding I wanted to have.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deployment and Divorce:</h2><p>In April of 2003, a year after her marriage, Gabbard enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. In July of 2004, she was deployed for a 12-month tour in Iraq, where she served as a specialist with the Medical Company, 29th Support Battalion, and 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Her tour ended in 2005 and a year later, she was preparing for divorce. The deployment was hard on Tamayo. Even though the marriage broke in 2006, Gabbard continued using Tamayo as her last name. However, she made the switch to Gabbard in 2010 and wrote a letter to all involved, which read,</p><p>“As you may know, my husband and I divorced a few years ago, shortly after I returned home from an 18-month long Iraq deployment with the Hawai’i Army National Guard. The deployment was very hard on my husband, and on our marriage. Sadly, Eddie and I became another statistic, another sad story, illustrating the stresses war places on military spouses and families.&nbsp; I had kept the Tamayo name in the hopes that we might still have a future together. However, recently I’ve come to fully realize that that’s not going to happen. Eddie and I are still friends, and I’m grateful the Tamayo family continues to welcome me as one of their own.”</p><p>During the years as a married couple, Eduardo Tamayo and Tulsi Gabbard did not give birth to any children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moving on:</h2><p>The marriage between Tamayo and Gabbard lasted nearly four years. It was back in 2006 when the marriage fell apart. Since Tamayo and Gabbard have gone on to spend more than 16 years apart, and according to Gabbard, she regards him as a friend even after the divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tulsi-Gabbard-current-husband-Abraham-Williams.jpg><p>Although Gabbard took her time, she found solace in the arm of Abraham Williams who is a cinematographer. In 2015, she married for the second time and took marriage vows with Williams in Kahaluu, Hawaii. Gabbard is yet to become a mother. Meanwhile, Tamayo maintains secrecy and keeps his existence a mystery to the media. It is not known if he married for the second time or remains single. Tamayo is not available on any kind of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eduardo Tamayo wiki/bio summary:</h2><p>The mystery man Edwardo Tamayo is so secretive that there is no available photo of him on the internet. And all biography articles on him are closely based on information coming from his ex-wife. If Tamayo’s reported birthdate of 1981 is true he is the same age as Tulsi Gabbard. Born in Hawaii, United States Tamayo is American by nationality and if ethnicity is concerned there is no family tree available to identify his lineage. If Eduardo Tomayo is related as reported to Toby Tamayo and grandfather General Antonio Tamayo he inherits Asian lineage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Tulsi Gabbard:</h2><p>Tulsi Gabbard American politician and military veteran who was born on April 12, 1981, in Leloaloa, American Samoa.
