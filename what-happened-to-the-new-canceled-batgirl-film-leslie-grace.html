Despite nearly being completed and filmed, the streaming service decided it would be better to cancel the project than see it through to the end.This anticipated film was where Leslie Grace's Batgirl AKA Barbara Gordon made an appearance alongside Michael Keaton, who was set to return as Batman. This shocking revelation is part of a series of cancelations and has left many worried for HBO MAX.

It had a strong emphasis on building streaming subscriptions for HBO Max through original content.</p><p>This included the controversial decision to release Warner Bros' entire 2021 theatrical slate including Dune, Godzilla Vs Kong, King Richard and The Matrix Resurrections on HBO MAX instead of making them cinema exclusive.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Twitter Roasts âDuneâ Creator For Complaining About HBO Max Release ">Twitter Roasts ‘Dune’ Creator For Complaining About HBO Max Release</a></span></p><p>It looks like Zaslav wants to concentrate on big screen releases, yet Batgirl was not considered big enough to have a theatrical release.

This means they have been forced to tighten their belts and find cost-saving measures where possible.</p><p>The decision to scrap Batgirl and Scoob, both almost completed movies appears to be an accounting loophole. It looks like the media giants can scrap these movies without having to carry the losses on its books. As a company that has recently changed hands, they apparently had until mid-August the exercise this option.</p><p>Because it is being used as a tax-write off, we will never be able to see it.

Maybe one day they will insha’Allah.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-batgirl-scrapped><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Was Batgirl Scrapped?</span></h2><p>Deadline noted that “the film tested once, and the result wasn’t that bad,” even when audiences were shown a cut that included temporary visual effects.
